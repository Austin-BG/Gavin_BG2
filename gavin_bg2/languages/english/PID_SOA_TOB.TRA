@128  = ~I have eyes. I also have enough common sense to know better than to answer that question. If I say that she's attractive, you'll think I'm after her myself, but if I say that she isn't, you'll accuse me of being blind or stupid. Better to keep my mouth shut and let you get on with it.~

@133  = ~If you're really not interested, you'd better break it off as soon as you can. Do it gently if you can, but if you can't, it's better to disappoint her now than it is to break her heart later.~

@159  = ~I'm blushing, aren't I? I'd probably better go stand in a corner for a while.~

@168  = ~He's a good man... but isn't he still mourning his wife?~
@169  = ~He's a pretty one, I'll give you that. Who cares about his bluster, or the fact that you have to flatter him night and day?~
@170  = ~He'll match your wits, that much is certain. <CHARNAME>, I don't know much about Edwin himself, but I do know that Red Wizards survive by getting the better of their rivals. They aren't nice. If you're determined to have him, I won't stand in your way, but I will urge caution. I don't want to see you get hurt.~
@171  = ~He thinks a lot of himself, doesn't he?~
@172  = ~You like mystery, eh? Well, he's got a lot of that.~
@173  = ~I don't know much about him, but I do know that he got the better of Phaere at least once. Tht makes him dangerous.~

@186  = ~Hmf. Who cares what's on the inside, as long as it's got a pretty wrapper, right?~
@187  = ~I never looked.~
@188  = ~He's never been 'sweet' to me, but maybe that's because he isn't trying to get me in bed with him. That's something to keep in mind, if you're wondering about his sincerity.~
@189  = ~(standing up a little straighter and puffing out his chest) I can't say I'd even notice that.~
@190  = ~If that's the kind of man you like.~
@191  = ~Why did you even ask me, then?~
@192  = ~I did warn you about that.~
@193  = ~Glad I asked.~
@194  = ~Good to know.~
@195  = ~Ah.~
@196  = ~I could tell you the story of how the Mulhorandi came to Abeir-Toril.~
@197  = ~The Mulhorandi?~
@198  = ~Go on.~
@199  = ~Thanks anyway, but history doesn't interest me all that much.~
@200  = ~They are an ancient nation far to the east, south of Thay.~
@201  = ~Let's have your story, then.~
@202  = ~Some other time, perhaps.~
@203  = ~Well, you must have heard of the Imaskari Empire, no?~
@204  = ~No, I haven't, actually.~
@205  = ~Who hasn't? Go on.~
@206  = ~Well, the Imaskari Empire once spanned most of Faerun. In their time, they were great indeed, and they possessed a knowledge of magic and mechanical devices that will never be seen again. They were succeeded by the Netherese, so that should give you some idea of their grandeur.~
@207  = ~Their empire was magnificent... and wealthy. Ever building, ever expanding, they eventually ran low on the slaves they needed to keep their extensive empire functioning. The fact that a plague recently decimated their labor force did not help.~
@208  = ~Their solution was to bring in thousands upon thousands of slaves from another world.~
@209  = ~Now you're having me on. Another world?~
@210  = ~Which world?~
@211  = ~This is a long story, isn't it?~
@212  = ~It's true. A race that invented extradimensional space would find little challenge in traversing the Astral Plane.~
@213  = ~The legends are silent about that, unfortunately.~
@214  = ~You were the one that wanted to pass the time while we travel. Do you want to hear it or not?~
@215  = ~Go ahead.~
@216  = ~No, I'll pass.~
@217  = ~Anyway, they needed slaves and they found them: a race with sun-bronzed skin and ink-black hair and eyes. This alien race became the Mulhorandi.~
@218  = ~You could have just said that they came from the Astral Plane.~
@219  = ~Wait, the Mulhorandi were slaves, but now they aren't. How were they freed?~
@220  = ~So the Imaskari brought the Mulhorandi here to become slaves. Now I know.~
@221  = ~Yes, but then I would not have had the opportunity to exhaust my vocabulary in thinking up other ways to say 'great.'~
@222  = ~All things that live can be killed, <CHARNAME>, and the Imaskari were no different.~
@223  = ~When the Mulhorandi came to Toril, they brought their gods with them. These gods lived among the Mulhorandi and bred with them. It is no coincidence that aasimar are so common in Mulhorand.~
@224  = ~Their divine blood gave them power, and they used it to overthrow their oppressors. Imaskar fell.~
@225  = ~But slavery is legal in Mulhorand. You'd think they wouldn't be so eager to enslave others, given their own history.~
@226  = ~So what happened to the Imaskari?~
@227  = ~Thanks for telling me that story.~
@228  = ~History has shown time and again that the first thing people will do when freed from one tyrant is to set up a new one. As a race, we humans are slow learners.~
@229  = ~Her cities were engulfed by flame and her people scattered. Some went on to become the Netherese, but the culture was lost forever.~
@230  = ~You sound saddened by that.~
@231  = ~The Netherese too were destroyed.~
@232  = ~This has turned out to be quite a long story.~
@233  = ~I'd hate to think any culture would be wiped from the face of Abeir-Toril, but the Imaskari Empire did have one other thing going for it. All races existed in peace there. Elves, dwarves, humans, all worked toward a common goal.~
@234  = ~Aye, for the Great Cycle applies to empires as readily as people. The refugees of the Imaskari Empire built the Netherese Empire, and the survivors of the Fall of Netheril went on to build Halruua. Perhaps one day, Halruua will rise to greatness, and then something else will take its place.~
@235  = ~All things end. It is a fact of life.~
@236  = ~Are you saying that all we do will end in ruin?~
@237  = ~Interesting story. Thank you.~
@238  = ~You do ramble on, you know.~
@239  = ~Is that the end of the story?~
@240  = ~So it is.~
@241  = ~No, I'm just telling a tale. You can take what you want from it.~
@242  = ~You're welcome.~
@243  = ~So I've been told.~
@244  = ~Stories never really end.~
@245  = ~Do you remember how I told you that the Mulhorandi people were brought to Abeir-Toril from another world along with their gods? Well, Osiris, Thoth, and friends were not the only gods rumored to have come from other Prime Material Planes.~
@246  = ~Tyr, Mielikki, and Loviatar are also said to have come from the same Prime as the Mulhorandi pantheon, though the reason for their existence here is not clear.~
@247  = ~History always seems to be silent when it comes to the good stuff.~
@248  = ~So their worshipers have been praying to false gods all this time?~
@249  = ~You said something about other Prime Material Planes. What do you mean?~
@250  = ~Well, that's enough about the gods, thanks.~
@251  = ~Perhaps there was no one there to record it. The Mulhorandi migration can be traced to a single place and time, but the tale of how Tyr, Mielikki and Loviatar came to Abeir-Toril is lost in antiquity.~
@252  = ~No, the gods are real, all right, as real as any native god.~
@253  = ~Other worlds... places like Abeir-Toril that exist beyond the Astral Plane. It's hard to explain and I get a headache if I think about it too much.~
@254  = ~So, the gods are here and they're real, even if we'll never know how they got here or why they were brought.~
@255  = ~Why they were brought? They were brought here for a reason?~
@256  = ~Who decided that we needed more gods, anyway?~
@257  = ~Do you think that some of the other gods might have started out somewhere else, too?~
@258  = ~What about the gods outside Faerun? They say that Kara-Tur has 8000 gods in its Celestial Bureaucracy.~
@259  = ~Ao himself decided there were voids to be filled in the divine governance of the Realms, and it was Ao that brought the gods from elsewhere. Who would dare speculate as to his motives?~
@260  = ~It's possible. It would take a better theologian than I to say with any certainty.~
@261  = ~I know next to nothing about religion in Kara-Tur, I'm afraid.~
@262  = ~There's a spring called Ceili's Veil near Ulgoth's Beard that erupts from the top of the cliff, then flows over a waterfall into the sea. There's a story about that waterfall, if you want to hear it.~
@263  = ~Sure.~
@264  = ~Not right now.~
@265  = ~Long ago, when Ulgoth's Beard was even smaller and more obscure than it is now, there lived a village maiden named Ceili. Her beauty was great, so when Duke Leoric of Baldur's Gate rode past, he fell instantly in love with her. He stopped his horse and commanded her to speak with him. She fled, but he pursued her. Day after day, he returned to court her, and day after day, she refused him, until one day, her heart softened, and she stayed to listen to the sweet words he lavished upon her. In time, she grew to care for him, as well. They stood there upon the cliff and pledged their love to each other with the sea as their witness.~
@266  = ~Leoric begged her to return with him to Baldur's Gate, and return with him she did, but when she arrived, she discovered that Leoric had failed to mention the wife and children he already had. Heartbroken, she left him and returned to Ulgoth's Beard.~
@267  = ~Alone, she climbed the cliff where they pledged their love. It is said that she dissolved in grief, and that her tears became the spring that flows forever into the sea.~
@268  = ~Well, that certainly is a depressing tale.~
@269  = ~Let that be a lesson to beautiful maidens everywhere! Before bestowing your heart, always ask whether the man is married.~
@270  = ~I don't understand why she behaved that way. Leoric wouldn't be the first nobleman to take a mistress.~
@271  = ~So, what happened to him?~
@272  = ~Interesting story.~
@273  = ~Not all stories have happy endings.~
@274  = ~That's probably sound advice.~
@275  = ~Not all people want to live like that, though.~
@276  = ~He died of a pestillence the very next year, or so I'm told. Perhaps the gods punished him for being false to Ceili... or to his wife.~
@277  = ~I know a story about a young <PRO_MANWOMAN> from Candlekeep who saved the Sword Coast from the evil machinations of Sarevok.~
@278  = ~I think I've heard that one before.~

@303  = ~What do you think of Yoshimo?~
@304  = ~She's a kind person, but I think she makes too much of past injuries.~
@305  = ~He's young. That excuses a lot. He's also cocky as hells, so I can't really say that I like him.~
@306  = ~I'm ashamed to admit it, but there are times he annoys the hells out of me. It's as if he read a book somewhere that said 'Druids should make obscure nature references in every sentence.'~
@307  = ~He thinks too much of himself.~
@308  = ~He likes his drama, doesn't he?~
@309  = ~I like her.~
@310  = ~She's got to have her fingers in every pot, that's for sure.~
@311  = ~His stories are ridiculous, but at least he's funny. Most of the time.~
@312  = ~He's an honorable man, and always worth listening to.~
@313  = ~He's loud, crass, and disgusting, but I'd hate to find myself on the wrong end of his axe.~
@314  = ~I wish there was a way to make her understand that she doesn't have to prove anything to us, but she's a good person.~
@315  = ~His heart is in the right place.~
@316  = ~She's a dreamer.~
@317  = ~He's suspicious, and that's a bit off-putting, but it's certainly understandable, considering what he's been through.~
@318  = ~All drow aren't Drizzt Do'Urden. That's all I'm saying.~
@319  = ~He's likable enough.~
@320  = ~I'm glad I met you.~
@321  = ~We have our differences, but on the whole, I like you.~
@322  = ~You're a good person.~
@323  = ~We have our differences, but you're alright.~
@324  = ~I'm still getting to know you, but so far, so good.~
@325  = ~It's too soon to tell.~
@326  = ~We have our differences, that's for sure.~
@327  = ~I don't know why I'm still here.~
@328  = ~I'm proud to be a part of your group.~
@329  = ~I should be more than satisfied with your leadership, but I find it difficult to accept some of your decisions.~
@330  = ~You're a fine leader.~
@331  = ~I can't complain, though I don't always agree with everything you do.~
@332  = ~You do alright.~
@333  = ~I always get the hard questions.~
@334  = ~You have many opportunities to improve.~
@335  = ~You need help... and a better conscience.~
@336  = ~I don't think much of it, to be completely honest with you.~
@337  = ~I don't even know why I'm here.~
@338  = ~He meant that the remains of those that were righteous in life become powerful and terrifying undead.~
@339  = ~Is it true?~
@340  = ~That's a disturbing thought.~
@341  = ~Wouldn't you have any control over that?~
@342  = ~Ah, I see.~
@343  = ~I don't know. It might be.~
@344  = ~Indeed.~
@345  = ~Probably not.~
@346  = ~This isn't something I'm comfortable talking about.~
@347  = ~In some ways, it was familiar. In the first part of the ritual that you recited, the worshiper says a prayer to greet the rising sun. That part is the same, though the prayer should be timed to end as the first rays of the new day break over the horizon. In the next step, a worshiper of Amaunator would have raised the book to be blessed by the first light. I would have raised my holy symbol. The third act would have been the same, rejoicing at the victory of light over darkness.~
@348  = ~Maybe the faiths are more similar than you thought.~
@349  = ~So why did you say that the ritual felt alien?~
@350  = ~I see.~
@351  = ~Perhaps, though it still feels... odd.~
@352  = ~The somatics are the same, but the meanings are different. I greet the rising sun as I would greet the bringer of life and hope, and the physical manifestation of my god. It isn't just 'Hmm, daylight. Time to say a prayer.'~
@353  = ~Then, when I raise my holy symbol, it's almost as if the sunlight charges it. It's probably my imagination, but it feels warmer afterward.~
@354  = ~And then, at the end, it's as much of a symbolic victory over the darkness of hate and despair as it is the literal brightening of shadows.~
@355  = ~To me, the Amaunatori Dawn Ritual seemed hollow, somehow, though the forms were familiar.~
@356  = ~I'm sure the rituals of your faith would seem just as hollow to an outsider.~
@357  = ~You think about all that before the sun is even properly over the horizon?~
@358  = ~It's just words, Gavin. You're making too much of it.~
@359  = ~It's a dead religion. You didn't expect anything to actually happen when I did those things, did you?~
@360  = ~Hmm. You're probably right.~
@361  = ~It takes years of training.~
@362  = ~I wouldn't expect you to understand.~
@363  = ~Dawnbringers usually use maces, but we aren't obligated to do so. I prefer hammers because, while a mace is always a weapon, a hammer is just a tool. It's a reminder that it's my decisions, not my abilities, that make me who I am.~
@364  = ~Certainly. I'll have it for you tomorrow.~
@365  = ~Aye, here it is.~
@366  = ~Not quite.~
@367  = ~I like to draw.~
@368  = ~That's right, I remember that you used to keep a sketchbook with you.~
@369  = ~You know, you could probably earn some coin doing that. Even if your drawings only sold for a few gold apiece, it would help.~
@370  = ~Interesting.~
@371  = ~That explains why you're always getting lost. You're always looking at the scenery.~
@372  = ~I'd be happy to help out any way I can. Just let me know when you want me to draw something.~
@373  = ~I never had a good sense of direction.~
@374  = ~Apart from my duties at the temple? Well, my family was there... Lanie, that is... so I mostly just did everyday things, like fix things around the house or run errands.~
@375  = ~My temple duties ended in the later part of the afternoon, so I'd usually go to the cottage and play with Lanie for a while.~
@376  = ~In the evenings, I'd sometimes go to the Red Sheaf for a mug of ale and a bit of gossip.~
@377  = ~Dawnbringers are usually called upon to bless new ventures, like business partnerships or the building of a new home, or to witness marriages and births, so I was usually there on behalf of the Temple, but I got to know the inhabitants pretty well.~
@378  = ~I was always devoted to the Morninglord, ever since I was a small child, so when I found out that I could heal people with magic, it seemed like the logical thing to do.~
@379  = ~How old were you when that happened?~
@380  = ~Did you ever consider doing anything else?~
@381  = ~Have you ever regretted that decision?~
@382  = ~What were your duties at the temple?~
@383  = ~I had twelve summers, at the time. After a seven year novitiate, I became a Dawnbringer.~
@384  = ~No, not really. I was so young when I developed my talents that it never occurred to me to try to be anything else. Was there something you had in mind?~
@385  = ~You like music. Have you ever thought about becoming a bard?~
@386  = ~You like being outdoors. You could have been a druid.~
@387  = ~You've got a bit of muscle on you, and apart from the whole spiders thing, you do well enough in combat. You would have made a good warrior.~
@388  = ~You like magic. Have you ever thought of trying your hand at it?~
@389  = ~You're passionate about your causes, and you always try to do what's right. You could have been a paladin.~
@390  = ~You like nature and your fighting skills aren't bad. You might have made a good ranger.~
@391  = ~You're good with your hands, and you're certainly nimble, even if you do trip over your own feet from time to time. Something roguish might have suited you.~
@392  = ~There are times we could use a blacksmith.~
@393  = ~You like to draw, and your work is pretty good. The extra coin would be welcome, if you ever decided to sell any of it.~
@394  = ~Have you ever heard me sing? Bad idea.~
@395  = ~I'm alright brewing potions, but I'm really bad keeping plants alive. It seems like all I have to do is look at them and they wither and die. And I'm not really all that good with animals, either, so it's probably for the best that I became a cleric instead.~
@396  = ~Er... have you noticed how clumsy I get when I'm under stress? Besides, I was never really interested in perfecting my fighting skills.~
@397  = ~I'm not really bright enough for that.~
@398  = ~I thought about that one once, but not everyone who wants to become a paladin has what it takes to succeed. I'll never have that kind of discipline.~
@399  = ~Heh. I like being around other people too much. I'd never be able to take the solitude.~
@400  = ~Not a chance. I know that not all thieves are evil backstabbers, but I just couldn't bring myself to do some of the things thieves do.~
@401  = ~I can pound dents out of armor as well as the next man, and if you've got some gear that needs mending, I'm your man, but if you think I'm going to walk around Faerun with a forge on my back and a sack of coal under each arm, you're crazy.~
@402  = ~Do you really think anyone would buy it?~
@403  = ~Sure, why not?~
@404  = ~Good point.~
@405  = ~Well, it's charcoal sketches mostly, but if you find a buyer and let me know when you want a sketch to sell, I'll make one up for you.~
@406  = ~Never.~
@407  = ~Dawnbringers are usually called upon to bless every new venture, so it mostly pertained to that. People would call on us when they were going into a new trade or building a house. Or they would call us if someone was was getting married or giving birth to a child. And then we had healing duties to attend, or delivering messages to other local temples. We also tended the temple fields, brewed potions for the sick, and generally did whatever needed doing.~
@408  = ~I can do that.~
@409  = ~If that's what you'd prefer, I can oblige.~
@410  = ~How... blunt.~
@411  = ~Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.~
@412  = ~I'm sorry, too.~
@413  = ~Is there any chance we can try again?~
@414  = ~I just wanted you to know.~
@415  = ~No. I'm sorry, but it's too late for that.~
@416  = ~You know, I believe we could. Would you want things to go back to the way they were before our... misunderstanding?~
@417  = ~I'd like that.~
@418  = ~Maybe someday. I wouldn't say it was impossible, but I need time. I need to be sure.~
@419  = ~I don't know. I'm starting to think it was the very idea of commitment that drove me away the first time.~
@420  = ~No, I don't think I can do this, after all. It hurts to let you go, but I'm just not ready yet.~
@421  = ~I'm sorry, but I can't. Not while another holds such a place in your heart.~
@422  = ~Then I'll end it with Anomen. Could we do it then?~
@423  = ~Then I'll end it with Edwin. Could we do it then?~
@424  = ~You know, I believe we could.~
@425  = ~That depends. Can you acknowledge the change in your beliefs?~
@426  = ~Yes, I can.~
@427  = ~No, I can't.~
@428  = ~Then I believe we could.~
@429  = ~Then I'm sorry, but it's just not possible.~
@430  = ~Thank you for telling me.~
@431  = ~So would I.~
@432  = ~I understand.~
@433  = ~Are you sure that's what you want? You know how important commitment is to me.~
@434  = ~I'm not afraid of commitment, exactly, but I think I might need more time.~
@435  = ~I don't know. I never expected it to be this hard.~
@436  = ~I don't want to hold you back, but I have to do what's right for me.~
@437  = ~Commitment might be important to you, but I hate the idea of it. I need to be free.~
@438  = ~It isn't always about you, Gavin. If it's going to work, it has to be right for both of us.~
@439  = ~It's hard, Gavin. I don't like being apart from you, but commitment terrifies me.~
@440  = ~I think I need to think about it some more.~
@441  = ~Maybe all I need is time. I think if we don't rush, and let things develop at their own pace, I might be ready to commit to you someday.~
@442  = ~I don't know what I want. I just don't know.~
@443  = ~I don't want you to be unhappy. You have to do what's right for you. I'll survive, no matter what you choose.~
@444  = ~I enjoy your company, and I like the... intimacy... we share, but I just don't want the commitment. I want the freedom to pursue other options.~
@445  = ~I just need to get used to the idea of being with someone. When you courted me before, I was swept off my feet, but our separation made me think. I need more time to decide what I'm going to do.~
@446  = ~I feel rushed, like you're trying to push me into a commitment before we're ready.~
@447  = ~I like sleeping with you, but I don't want to be tied down.~
@448  = ~I'm a flirt, Gavin. I enjoy it too much to give it up, even for you.~
@449  = ~Why don't you sleep on it for a while. We can talk about it again when you've had time to focus your thoughts and decide what you want from a relationship.~
@450  = ~Let me make sure I understand you, because if we start down this road, there is no turning back.~
@451  = ~You want to go back to talking and flirting like we used to do, or sharing my bed, if the mood takes you, but you want to be able to lie with any other man you choose?~
@452  = ~That is exactly what I want.~
@453  = ~I don't know if I'd put it so bluntly, but yes.~
@454  = ~No, Gavin, I don't want to bed other men. I just don't want a commitment. Like it was before we became engaged.~
@455  = ~I think I'd rather just be friends.~
@456  = ~Gods, the last thing I wanted to do was rush you about something that important. How can we make this right?~
@457  = ~I'd like to leave things as they are and think about it for a while.~
@458  = ~I want things to be like they were before we became engaged.~
@459  = ~I'll be honest. I did enjoy lying with you, so I'd like to be able to do that again, I just don't want the commitment that goes along with it.~
@460  = ~I just don't know.~
@461  = ~Are you absolutely certain? Because if this is what you choose, there is no going back, and if you put me aside even then, it really will be over between us.~
@462  = ~Can you explain that a little more fully?~
@463  = ~I am certain. I want a casual relationship with you and the freedom to do what I want with anyone else.~
@464  = ~On second thought, maybe I should think about it a little longer.~
@465  = ~At least we have that.~
@466  = ~It would mean that if I agree to be your plaything, with no promise of a future, there are going to be some changes.~
@467  = ~If you send me from your side for any reason, it's over. Even if you ask me to come back, we will never be any more than friends.~
@468  = ~And if you choose to come to my bed, I'll do whatever I have to do to make sure there are no consequences. I will not father a child I can't raise.~
@469  = ~So, there's no downside! I like it!~
@470  = ~I can accept those terms.~
@471  = ~Maybe we could just go back to the way it was before we became engaged.~
@472  = ~Maybe I should think about this some more.~
@473  = ~If that's the way you want it.~
@474  = ~What's on your mind?~
@475  = ~Do you see this going anywhere?~
@476  = ~I've been thinking about your proposal to me, Gavin, and I've changed my mind. I would like to marry you, if you'll still have me.~
@477  = ~I've thought it through, and I think I'm ready. Will you come to my bed tonight?~
@478  = ~Will you come to my bed tonight?~
@479  = ~Let's have a bath sent to our room.~
@480  = ~You don't have to mind your language around me. I like it when you're naughty.~
@481  = ~Don't take this the wrong way, but I have rather delicate sensibilities. Some of the things you say are a bit offensive.~
@482  = ~Do you remember that talk we had about responsibility and your desire not to bring a child into the world right now?~
@483  = ~I wanted to talk to you about something that happened earlier... an indiscretion I made.~
@484  = ~I don't want you to stop talking to me, Gavin, but would you mind not flirting with me so much? It gets a little distracting, at times.~
@485  = ~You used to pay me a lot more attention than you do now. I miss it.~
@486  = ~This is difficult for me to say, but I'm beginning to think we should end our engagement.~
@487  = ~I'm sorry, Gavin, but we need to end this.~
@488  = ~Nevermind.~
@489  = ~You want to bathe together? No, <CHARNAME>, I don't think that's a good idea.~
@490  = ~Oh, come on, Gavin! It will be fun!~
@491  = ~Why not? You like trying new things.~
@492  = ~Why so bashful? I've seen you naked before.~
@493  = ~You'd do it if you loved me.~
@494  = ~You'd do it if you cared about me at all.~
@495  = ~Nevermind, then.~
@496  = ~I'll take a bath before I come to your room, but I would rather do it alone.~
@497  = ~Let's do it together. You like trying new things.~
@498  = ~I was planning on taking a bath anyway, but that's something I usually do alone.~
@499  = ~Sorry to disappoint you, but I'd really rather bathe alone.~
@500  = ~Thank you for understanding.~
@501  = ~You know I always try to make you happy, but this really isn't something I enjoy.~
@502  = ~Oh, alright... though I want you to know that I'm only agreeing to this because I want to make you happy.~
@503  = ~That isn't the point. I'll lounge around naked in your room all night if you want, but when I'm in the tub, I want to get clean.~
@504  = ~That isn't the point... but I'll do it if it makes you happy.~
@505  = ~Who taught you that clever bit of manipulation? Now I've got to do it... though I'm acting under duress.~
@506  = ~(sigh) Of course I love you, dear. Very well, let's send for the tub.~
@507  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I really do like that little bit of privacy I get in the bath. I hope you understand.~
@508  = ~Maybe some other time, alright?~
@509  = ~Besides, nobody wants to see somebody else scrubbing all the parts that need a good scrub, right?~
@510  = ~You should consider yourself lucky. You'd have to listen to me sing, otherwise.~
@511  = ~(You place your order with the innkeeper, who merely shrugs and rings for a chambermaid. Barely half an hour later, a timid woman appears at your elbow informing you that your bath is ready. When you reach your room, however, you see that the wooden tub in your room is quite small, barely large enough for one, and certainly not big enough for two.)~
@512  = ~Isn't this always the way? How are we supposed to fit in that? How am *I* supposed to fit in that?~
@513  = ~We'll just have to bathe standing up. It won't be that bad.~
@514  = ~It might work if I sit on your lap.~
@515  = ~We can sit on the edge of the tub and sponge each other off.~
@516  = ~I'll get in the tub and you can sit on the edge. We can still get clean even if we both aren't in the water.~
@517  = ~Maybe we should just take turns.~
@518  = ~I'm game if you are... AAAIIYE!~
@519  = ~Aha... I see the prospect of having you on my lap is having its usual effect. If you get in that tub with me, you're likely to find your seat a little more invasive than you expect.~
@520  = ~It's all part of the plan, Gavin.~
@521  = ~I don't mind that one bit!~
@522  = ~Let's take turns, then.~
@523  = ~Alright, it seems like the tub is strong enough to support us, after all. Now hand me that sponge...~
@524  = ~If it means I get to rub you all over, this might not be too bad!~
@525  = ~(You place your order with the innkeeper, who merely shrugs and rings for a chambermaid. An hour or so later, a timid woman appears at your elbow informing you that your bath is ready. When you reach your room, you find an enormous copper bathtub and a large stack of fluffy towels.)~
@526  = ~This is a pleasant change! We might actually be able to fit in this thing.~
@527  = ~What are you waiting for? Get in!~
@528  = ~We could have all kinds of fun in a tub like this!~
@529  = ~They even remembered the linens! Grab that sponge and let's get in.~
@530  = ~I even like the scent of the soap.~
@531  = ~Maybe we should stil take turns.~
@532  = ~Alright, I'll just get in first so I don't knock you over with my flailing about... AAIIIYE!~
@533  = ~Aha... there seems to be a response from certain quarters already. If you get in that tub with me, I doubt that I'll be able to keep my mind on getting clean.~
@534  = ~Right. Let me just get this sponge nice and soapy...~
@535  = ~Hmmm, yes, and the thought of rubbing you all over with that is making this sound better and better.~
@536  = ~(You place your order with the innkeeper, who merely shrugs and rings for a chambermaid. An hour or so later, a timid woman appears at your elbow informing you that your bath is ready. When you reach your room, the first thing you notice is the steam. The second thing you notice is that it all seems to be coming out of the bathtub, which is half-filled with scalding hot water.)~
@537  = ~It might be a while before we can get that bath, after all.~
@538  = ~I think we're supposed to adjust the temperature with those buckets of water beside it.~
@539  = ~I'm sure you can think of something to do while we wait.~
@540  = ~If we just dip the sponge, we should be able to soap up without burning ourselves. By the time we're done with that, it will probably be cool enough to rinse off.~
@541  = ~Better too hot than too cold. Besides, it gives us longer to play!~
@542  = ~We'll wait a bit and then we'll take turns.~
@543  = ~Alright, I'll just get the bucket and dump in some cold... AAIIYEE!~
@544  = ~Aha... it looks like some parts of me are getting some ideas of their own. I should be able to restrain myself until we can get in the water, but after that... well, I don't know how much washing you'll get done.~
@545  = ~Hmm, yes, it doesn't seem to be too bad this way. Let's just get this sponge soaped up...~
@546  = ~If you mean running my soapy hands all over your body, this might turn out better than I hoped.~
@547  = ~(You place your order with the innkeeper, who merely shrugs and rings for a chambermaid. An hour or so later, a timid woman appears at your elbow informing you that your bath is ready. When you reach your room, you find a slimy-looking wooden tub with a few inches of ice-cold water in the bottom.)~
@548  = ~This doesn't look too appealing, does it?~
@549  = ~Why don't you just run down to the kitchen for a couple of kettles of boiling water?~
@550  = ~Let's just wash off the worst of the grime and find a more pleasant diversion.~
@551  = ~We can just sponge each other off. We'll be spared the worst of the chill until it's time to rinse.~
@552  = ~We might as well make the most of it. At least the soap looks clean.~
@553  = ~Maybe we should just take turns. It would be quicker that way.~
@554  = ~Good idea. I'll just grab one of these empty pails and... AAIIYEE!~
@555  = ~I'll just get in the tub then, and you can hold on to me to warm up... and it seems like the cold water isn't having its usual effect on me. I don't suppose you'd be inclined to help me with this...~
@556  = ~If you say so. I'll just get this sponge nice and soapy...~
@557  = ~That it does... and the prospect of running my soapy hands all over your body doesn't sound too bad, either.~
@558  = ~I'll go first.~
@559  = ~You can go first.~
@560  = ~(The pleasure of being clean is about the only enjoyment you are likely to get out of this bath, as Gavin keeps himself to himself until you have finished. Once you are out of the water, he takes his turn, attacking his body vigorously with the washcloth and rinsing off before you have even finished combing out your hair.)~
@561  = ~Well, we're clean, so we might as well get some rest. It will be another full day tomorrow.~
@562  = ~(Gavin bathes quickly, attacking his body vigorously with the washcloth and sluicing off the soap before you have even finished undressing.

@569  = ~I'll be alright after I've had a chance to lie down for a while. Luckily, that was the floorboard cracking, and not my skull. If you don't mind, though, I'd like to go someplace quiet for a while... get rid of this headache.~
@570  = ~Your concern for my wellbeing is truly touching.~
@571  = ~(Your closeness invites touching, and touching soon becomes kissing... and then something more. When your exertions end at last, the little water that remains in the tub is barely tepid, but you are both completely satisfied.)~
@572  = ~And now, my dear, it's time for bed.~
@573  = ~(He dabs the soapy sponge playfully on your chin, but quickly becomes engrossed in his task, running the sponge along your collarbone, then over your breast and down your flank.)~
@574  = ~Mmm, yes... don't stop there!~
@575  = ~No, Gavin, don't. Let's not get carried away!~
@576  = ~(He eagerly soaps up both hands and begins stroking you.)~
@577  = ~Right. Maybe we'd better just finish up and get some rest.~
@578  = ~You have? That's wonderful! Thank you, <CHARNAME>! Nothing you could have said would have made me happier!~
@579  = ~Are you sure? I can get a bit... er... explicit at times.~
@580  = ~Please do!~
@581  = ~On second thought, maybe you'd better continue to use restraint.~
@582  = ~I'll keep that in mind.~
@583  = ~Of course! I don't want to offend you.~
@584  = ~I'm not sure I know what you mean.~
@585  = ~You know, you and I.~
@586  = ~I'm not sure I do, either.~
@587  = ~Are all men as dense as you?~
@588  = ~Er... perhaps we'd better save that question for another day.~
@589  = ~Ahem. Yes.~
@590  = ~Most likely.~
@591  = ~I certainly hope so!~
@592  = ~No. I used to think that maybe... but no, that door is closed forever.~
@593  = ~If that's what you'd like, I can certainly oblige.~
@594  = ~What? Oh, <CHARNAME>, do you really mean that?~
@595  = ~I'm afraid I do, Gavin. We need to end this now before we start to resent each other.~
@596  = ~It isn't working and there's nothing we can do to fix it. You are wrong for me, and always will be. It's over, and it's over for good.~
@597  = ~I thought I could handle this, but I just can't. I wish things could go back to the way they were before we became engaged.~
@598  = ~The lovemaking is all right, but the commitment is just too hard to take. I need to be free.~
@599  = ~There are just so many things I still want to do before I get tied down.~
@600  = ~You might be ready for 'forever,' but I'm not. I want to see what else is out there.~
@601  = ~No... I guess I don't. Sometimes, the thought of being with one person forever is overwhelming, but I think we'll be all right.~
@602  = ~I'm sorry you feel that way, but I want you to be happy. If you want to end the engagement, well, that's the way it has to be.~
@603  = ~It won't be easy, but we can certainly try.~
@604  = ~I think we will, too.~
@605  = ~Er... yes. If that's what you want.~
@606  = ~I can't say I'm surprised, but it's just as well. This is not a life I would have chosen for myself.~
@607  = ~Remember, though, that I said there is no going back. From this day forward, we will never be more than friends.~
@608  = ~If you're ready...~
@609  = ~This is a big step, love, and I know I'm ready, but it has to be right for both of us. I'll come to you tonight, and we'll talk more about it then... alone.~
@610  = ~This is a big step, and I'm still willing, but it has to be your decision. I'll come to you tonight, and we'll talk more about it then... alone.~
@611  = ~I will.~
@612  = ~Oh? What indiscretion are you talking about?~
@613  = ~My 'practice' with Anishai.~
@614  = ~My meeting with Aran Linvail.~
@615  = ~What happened with Bjornin.~
@616  = ~What I said about Chanelle.~
@617  = ~My night with Coran.~
@618  = ~What happened with Desharik.~
@619  = ~You know, with Edwin.~
@620  = ~That foolishness with Eldoth.~

@625  = ~My evening with Logan.~
@626  = ~My 'apprenticeship' with Mekrath.~
@627  = ~That incident with Ribald.~

@629  = ~Between myself and Solaufein.~
@630  = ~You can't have forgotten Talak.~
@631  = ~What I did with Cernd.~
@632  = ~Ah, yes. That was rather uncomfortable to listen to.~
@633  = ~Gavin, I'm sorry I put you through that. I was being selfish, and I'm sorry.~
@634  = ~I've been thinking about how you must have felt. I never wanted to hurt you.~
@635  = ~Gods know what you must think of me, but I want you to know that of all my companions, yours is the opinion that means the most.~
@636  = ~It wasn't your place to judge me.~
@637  = ~You're just going to have to accept that it happened and move on.~
@638  = ~The master of all he surveys? I can't say I'm eager to talk about him again, but go on.~
@639  = ~I lied to you, Gavin. Nothing happened that night, but I was trying to impress you. I'm sorry for deceiving you.~
@640  = ~I was trying to make you jealous. It worked, all right, but now I see how wrong I was to do it in the first place. I never wanted to hurt you.~
@641  = ~You must have known I was exaggerating, and I hate to think what your opinion of me must be. I shouldn't have lied to you.~
@642  = ~You're just going to have to accept what happened and move on.~
@643  = ~You regret it now? You were quick enough to boast of your conquest at the time.~
@644  = ~I'm starting to understand that intimacy is something to rejoice in, not to brag about. I only wish I'd learned this sooner.~
@645  = ~I was so thrilled with having that much ability to excite a man that I never stopped to consider the consequences, or even who I was talking to.~
@646  = ~I shouldn't have made so light of it. You place a high value on physical intimacy, and I should have had more respect for your beliefs.~
@647  = ~Your first conquest in your new estate? Yes, I remember.~
@648  = ~I regret what I did, Gavin. She was offering me her body as a servant to a mistress, and it was wrong of me to take advantage of her like that.~
@649  = ~I honestly don't know what came over me. I don't usually indulge my appetites so indescriminately.~
@650  = ~I believe you think less of me because of how I treated Chanelle. I never wanted to lose your affection, Gavin, or your respect.~
@651  = ~Oh, please! Do we really have to talk about that womanizer again?~
@652  = ~I can't believe what I did. When I look back on it, all I can think about is what a horrible mistake I made.~
@653  = ~I don't know what I was hoping to recapture. Maybe I hoped to find some trace of the Coran that used to be, but I should have seen that the Coran I knew is long gone. I should have just left the past behind.~
@654  = ~How could I not have seen how much my affair with Coran would have bothered you? I never meant to hurt you.~
@655  = ~I'm still finding it difficult to believe that you enjoyed the way he treated you.~
@656  = ~I was lying to myself as much as to you. I needed to believe I was in control.~
@657  = ~It was the madness of the place, I think. I'm not normally that... perverse. Now that the moment has passed, I'm a bit ashamed of what I did.~
@658  = ~It was your choice, <CHARNAME>. There isn't much to be said about it.~
@659  = ~I was foolish, Gavin. I should have known that nothing good would come of my affair with Edwin. It was a mistake and I regret it.~
@660  = ~I was trying to make you jealous, Gavin. I shouldn't have played with your emotions like that.~
@661  = ~You must have a low opinion of me indeed, after what I did, and I regret that. I never wanted to lose your affection.~
@662  = ~Yes... Eldoth. What a snake.~
@663  = ~I should never have trusted him. I should have come straight back to the common room when I found out what he was about.~
@664  = ~I was foolish to let my appetites cloud my judgment like that. Can you forgive me?~
@665  = ~I still can't believe you enjoyed being used like that. And with such a... ahem. You wanted to talk?~
@666  = ~It was an act, Gavin. After the humiliation I'd already been through, I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing me beaten.~
@667  = ~I was trying to get a reaction out of you. I needed to know that you cared. I'm sorry for manipulating you like that.~
@668  = ~Gods know what you must think of me, after that. Your good opinion is the one thing I really don't want to lose.~
@669  = ~Hmm, yes, you did brag about that conquest.~
@670  = ~It was very wrong for me to boast like that. I should have had more respect for his dignity and kept the matter to myself.~
@671  = ~I've been thinking about how you must have felt, listening to my boasting. I never wanted to hurt you.~
@672  = ~I was trying to impress you, but I guess I tried too hard. I should have just let things run their course.~
@673  = ~I'm surprised he didn't call us all out as frauds, to be honest. You must have pleasured him greatly.~
@674  = ~I wasn't thinking. I thought only of my own desires, and my recklessness could have endangered us all. I'm sorry.~
@675  = ~I was being impulsive, though I know now that I was wrong. I got carried away by the idea of drow sensuality and it affected my judgment.~
@676  = ~He'll be with his unit by now. Well, if he's marching to his death, at least he'll have a smile on his face.~
@677  = ~I should never have gone with him. It was easy enough to see what he wanted, but he flattered me, Gavin, and made me feel special. I should have had more restraint.~
@678  = ~Everything we touch is corrupted, Gavin. Evil has spread its tendrils throughout our lives. Is it so wrong for me to have wanted a pure, untainted thing?~
@679  = ~I was with Laran, Gavin, but I would rather have gone to the bed of another... a kind, gentle man who is too shy for his own good. I thought that if I made you jealous, it might encourage you to be bolder.~
@680  = ~Ah, yes, your good friend Lord Coprith.~
@681  = ~I lied to you, Gavin. Nothing happened, but I wanted to you to think that something did. I hoped it would encourage you to make a move on me yourself.~
@682  = ~I've been thinking about what I said, and I must have made you feel pretty insignificant. I'm sorry for hurting you.~
@683  = ~You must think me a power-hungry bitch, after what I said to you. I'm sorry, Gavin. I never wanted you to think of me that way.~
@684  = ~The blue mage? What is there to say about him?~
@685  = ~I let my desires overcome my sense, Gavin, and I regret that now. I should have shown more restraint.~
@686  = ~Of all the consequences of that encounter, the one I regret most is losing your good opinion. I wish you could forgive me.~
@687  = ~Oh, him. He might not be much on fancy illustrations, but I bet he's got a couple of you by now.~
@688  = ~Gavin, I don't know what I was thinking. I gave in to the whim of a moment, and now I'm afraid that my foolishness has stunted someting that I wanted to grow.~
@689  = ~I just wanted to let you know that I'm sorry for subjecting you to... what I subjected you to. It must not have been very enjoyable for you to stand around and wait while I was otherwise occupied, especially when it might have bothered you for other reasons.~
@690  = ~It bothers me that your opinion of me may have sunk because of what happened. I don't know what I would do if I lost your respect.~
@691  = ~There aren't many secrets on a ship.~
@692  = ~I know... and that's why I did it. I wanted to make you jealous.~
@693  = ~You must think me lower than dirt to lie with that scum... and I'm starting to believe that you may be right. Please forgive me, Gavin. I don't want to lose your good opinion.~
@694  = ~You asked for that one.~
@695  = ~I should have anticipated that you wouldn't want to be kept on guard duty while I entertained myself. I was being selfish, and I'm sorry.~
@696  = ~I've been thinking about how you must have felt, knowing what I did. I never wanted to hurt you.~
@697  = ~I lied to you, Gavin. I never lay with Solaufein. I made up the whole story to preserve our disguises.~
@698  = ~Your reward?~
@699  = ~Yes... I've been thinking about that, and I can't believe how selfish I was. I'm sorry.~
@700  = ~We were all under a lot of pressure, at the time, and I saw that as a way to relieve some of it. I never wanted to hurt you.~
@701  = ~Your good opinion means much to me, Gavin, and it bothers me to think that my foolishness may have damaged that.~
@702  = ~What's to say? You felt a need, Cernd satisfied it.~
@703  = ~I wasn't thinking of Cernd's needs, though... or of yours. I was being selfish, and I'm sorry.~
@704  = ~I'm ashamed to admit this, but on some level, I think I was trying to prove something to you. I wanted you to understand that if you were unwilling to satisfy my needs, I would find someone else. I shouldn't have done that.~
@705  = ~Things are tense enough between you and Cernd. I should never have indulged in a way that contributed to the friction between you.~
@706  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, you don't have to try so hard to make me want you. I'm not blind to your charms, but if something is going to happen between us, it's going to happen because we're ready for it to happen, not because you've driven me mad with jealousy.~
@707  = ~That certainly makes more sense. I'm sorry for having spoken to you so harshly.~
@708  = ~It isn't your fault, <CHARNAME>. None of us are perfect all the time, and there's no harm done.~
@709  = ~I don't judge you, <CHARNAME>, but that doesn't mean I can't have an opinion.~
@710  = ~I must. I have no choice.~
@711  = ~Of course, I remember it. You're not...~
@712  = ~I'd like you to take care of that responsibility from now on.~
@713  = ~I'm not, but we're running low on supplies.~
@714  = ~Are you still certain you don't want to have a baby?~
@715  = ~Gladly. You'll never have to worry about it again.~
@716  = ~I think I've got some in my medicine kit. Half a moment...~
@717  = ~Ah, yes. Here it is.~
@718  = ~On the contrary, I do want to have a child with you. I just don't want to do it right now, with your quest unfinished and our lives so uncertain. When this is over, you have my word that I'll give you as many children as I'm able... or as many as you want.~
@719  = ~(You...)~
@720  = ~(Smile at Gavin.)~
@721  = ~(You compliment Gavin.)~
@722  = ~I have something for you.~
@723  = ~I've been thinking about the past.~
@724  = ~I need your help with something.~
@725  = ~Will you dance with me, Gavin?~

@727  = ~I draw, too, and I've been wondering if you'd be willing to pose nude for me sometime.~
@728  = ~(You wait until Gavin is walking beside you and then you sing softly, so that he alone can hear you.)~
@729  = ~(Hug Gavin.)~
@730  = ~(You kiss Gavin's cheek.)~
@731  = ~(You kiss Gavin's lips.)~
@732  = ~(You hold Gavin's hand.)~
@733  = ~(You pose for Gavin.)~
@734  = ~(You take Gavin's arm.)~
@735  = ~(You touch him.)~
@736  = ~(You call a halt and let Gavin unsling his pack. You then proceed to rub his neck.)~
@737  = ~(You allow him to draw even with you, then casually allow your hand to brush against his groin.)~
@738  = ~(You wait until you are certain Gavin is watching you and then pout, letting a tear form in the corner of your eye.)~
@739  = ~(You study Gavin's face while his attention is focused elsewhere.)~
@740  = ~(With Gavin's attention diverted, you may look at his body without being observed.)~
@741  = ~(You let Gavin catch you admiring him.)~
@742  = ~(You flirt with <PLAYER2> in front of Gavin.)~
@743  = ~(You flirt with <PLAYER3> in front of Gavin.)~
@744  = ~(You flirt with <PLAYER4> in front of Gavin.)~
@745  = ~(You flirt with <PLAYER5> in front of Gavin.)~
@746  = ~(You flirt with <PLAYER6> in front of Gavin.)~

@748  = ~(You flirt with Keldorn in front of Gavin.)~
@749  = ~(You flirt with Valygar in front of Gavin.)~
@750  = ~(You leave Gavin alone.)~
@751  = ~Uh-oh. Whatever they said, it's not true.~
@752  = ~What would make you think somebody was telling tales on you?~
@753  = ~A pity. I hoped it might be.~
@754  = ~Probably not. Such a shame.~
@755  = ~They said you're an honorable man... or mostly honorable.~
@756  = ~I just know.~
@757  = ~What did they say?~
@758  = ~Ha! Nobody said anything. I just wanted to see your face.~
@759  = ~It isn't something I'd repeat in polite company.~
@760  = ~They said you like naughty girls.~
@761  = ~I heard that priests really know what to do when they're on their knees.~
@762  = ~They say you have superhuman self-control.~
@763  = ~I hear you've got a fine head for ale.~
@764  = ~Why don't you just drop your leggings and I'll see for myself.~
@765  = ~Well, I'm sure that look of shock and horror didn't disappoint, then.~
@766  = ~(He just looks away, his blush flaming in his cheeks.)~
@767  = ~I like nice ones, too! Er... I mean, I prefer women who... Maybe I'd better just shut up.~
@768  = ~If you mean pray, then you'd be right.~
@769  = ~Sometimes. Other times, I stammer and make an ass of myself.~
@770  = ~If they meant that I have a couple of drinks and act like an idiot, they could be right.~
@771  = ~Ahem. Everybody likes a good mystery.~
@772  = ~Oh. Well, I try.~
@773  = ~I've got some article of clothing on inside out again, don't I?~
@774  = ~(He smiles back, then staggers as he trips over some uneven ground.)~
@775  = ~(He looks around to see who you're smiling at, then reddens and grins sheepishly.)~
@776  = ~A moment, <CHARNAME>, you've got a hair stuck to your lip.~
@777  = ~Oh, gods, please tell me my laces are done...~
@778  = ~(At first, he doesn't smile back, but spends several long moments looking at your face. At last, he looks away, giving you the barest glimpse of a grin.)~
@779  = ~A fine sight, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~
@780  = ~(He reaches out to touch one corner of your mouth, as if puzzled by your expression.)~
@781  = ~(He grins back at you.)~
@782  = ~You have the most beautiful smile...~
@783  = ~(He cradles your cheek in his hand and kisses you soundly.)~
@784  = ~Why are you smiling?~
@785  = ~I'm happy you're here.~
@786  = ~Just thinking of something.~
@787  = ~No reason.~
@788  = ~I'm happy I'm here, too.~
@789  = ~Where else would I be?~
@790  = ~Then show me how much. (He sweeps you into his arms and kisses you soundly.)~
@791  = ~Wonderful. Now I'll be walking around with a big grin all day and people will look at me like I'm mad. But they probably already do that.~
@792  = ~You're not plotting anything naughty, I hope... What am I saying? Plan away, and then spring it on me when we're alone.~
@793  = ~A woman is smiling, and says that she's thinking of something. There are so many ways this could go wrong.~
@794  = ~Me, too... about how lucky I am to have you.~
@795  = ~Now I know I'm in trouble.~
@796  = ~It's a funny thing. If a woman walks around smiling for no reason, people will think she's beautiful. If I do it, people think I'm an idiot.~
@797  = ~Well, if you were trying to brighten my day, it worked. Thanks, love.~
@798  = ~We're probably safe enough.~
@799  = ~So it would seem.~
@800  = ~We both know that's not true.~
@801  = ~You already know all there is to know about that.~
@802  = ~Ask me when we're alone if you want to find out.~
@803  = ~I thought so, once.~
@804  = ~(You tell him...)~

@808  = ~You're a good man, Gavin.~
@809  = ~(You remain silent.)~
@810  = ~Thank you.~
@811  = ~I do my best.~
@812  = ~I'm just trying to do the will of the Morninglord.~
@813  = ~I thank you for the compliment, but I'm only trying to follow the teachings of my god.~
@814  = ~I'm glad you think so.~
@815  = ~I try.~
@816  = ~You bring out the best in me.~
@817  = ~I'm glad you still think so.~
@818  = ~I'm a lucky man, too.~
@819  = ~Apparently, that isn't enough.~
@820  = ~The question is 'Good at what?'~
@821  = ~I do the work of my god. Nothing more.~
@822  = ~I hope I didn't offend you. I didn't realize anyone could see me.~
@823  = ~Ahem. Thank you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go stand by myself for a while... and possibly chew on my gauntlets until the urge to babble goes away.~
@824  = ~As long as you like the way I look, I'm glad.~
@825  = ~If you want a better look, just call me to your bed tonight.~
@826  = ~(blushing furiously) Is that so?~
@827  = ~Wha-... I mean... really? Oh...~
@828  = ~Are you trying to tell me something? No... I'd be better off not knowing.~
@829  = ~Oh? Er... thank you... I think...~
@830  = ~If you say so...~
@831  = ~Maybe, but telling them that tends to make them babble and trip over things.~
@832  = ~And that makes me a lucky, lucky man.~
@833  = ~I'm not *that* shy! Well... maybe a little.~
@834  = ~As long as you do, that's all I care about.~
@835  = ~I'll let you know if I see any.~
@836  = ~Those days are long gone for me.~
@837  = ~So I should probably make myself scarce if you find one.~
@838  = ~Thank you!~
@839  = ~Just doing my job.~
@840  = ~I know you like sweets, so I picked up some candied apricots for you.~
@841  = ~You're looking a little thin these days, so I made you some honey cakes. I hope you like them.~
@842  = ~Close your eyes!~
@843  = ~It's a flower.~
@844  = ~You'll have to wait. I'm saving it for later.~
@845  = ~Never mind.~
@846  = ~Oh, the torture! Now I'll be wondering what you're up to all day.~
@847  = ~Why, thank you! I love apricots!~
@848  = ~That was very thoughtful. Thank you.~
@849  = ~Mmm. These are delicious. Have some!~
@850  = ~That was very kind of you, but my stomach is a bit off right now. Can we save them for later?~
@851  = ~How thoughtful! Thank you very much.~
@852  = ~It's beautiful, but it seems a shame to pick such a beautiful flower for me. Here, it will look much better on you. (He gently tucks the flower behind your ear.)~
@853  = ~It's lovely... like you.~
@854  = ~(A bee crawls out as you give it to him and stings him on the hand. He drops the flower in surprise.)~
@855  = ~Oops. Let's just give this a good shake before I put this through my belt. Much safer that way. Thank you for the flower, though!~
@856  = ~Oh, my favorite! Thank you!~
@857  = ~These are delicious! And nice and gooey, just the way I like them. Want to share?~
@858  = ~Trying to fatten me up, eh? Well, I have lost weight, so I won't argue with that. They're very good, though. You're an excellent cook.~
@859  = ~These are even better than my mother's!~
@860  = ~What a thoughtful gift! Thank you!~
@861  = ~Thank you! They... er... Are honey cakes supposed to be this crispy?~
@862  = ~It's a special recipe.~
@863  = ~The fire was a bit too hot.~
@864  = ~I toasted them for you.~
@865  = ~I guess I'm not a very good cook.~
@866  = ~If you don't want the cakes, I'll eat them.~
@867  = ~Ah, well, I'll try anything once!~
@868  = ~That happens. They'll still be tasty.~
@869  = ~Ah... thank you.~
@870  = ~That's alright. I eat anything.~
@871  = ~We can share.~
@872  = ~(He obediently closes his eyes.)~
@873  = ~(You kiss him firmly on the lips.)~
@874  = ~(You seize a fistful of cloth in each hand and yank his leggings down.)~
@875  = ~(You walk away.)~
@876  = ~<CHARNAME>? Where did you go?~
@877  = ~(His eyes fly open and he catches his leggings on the way down, saving himself a great deal of embarrassment.)~
@878  = ~Whoa, <CHARNAME>! I can live without surprises like that!~
@879  = ~(He clutches at his descending leggings, but misses. Fortunately for his dignity, his small clothes remained in place.)~
@880  = ~What an incredibly childish thing to do!~
@881  = ~(He flails around, trying to prevent the inevitable, but fails. With both leggings and small clothes around his knees, he tries unsuccessfully to cover himself. Finally, he manages to get his clothing back where it was. He walks away in disgust.)~
@882  = ~(He lets out a strangled yelp and drops to the ground clutching himself. You might not have gotten his leggings down, but you seem to have damaged something dear to him.)~
@883  = ~(His eyes fly open the moment your lips meet his. He gasps and pulls away from you.)~
@884  = ~<CHARNAME>... what... ?~
@885  = ~You needed a kiss.~
@886  = ~Didn't you like it?~
@887  = ~You're too shy, Gavin.~
@888  = ~Let's see you walk a straight line now!~
@889  = ~Is something wrong?~
@890  = ~Maybe, but... it's so soon...~
@891  = ~Aye, but it's too soon!~
@892  = ~I just need a little time, that's all.~
@893  = ~I think I'd better just stand here a moment... in shocked disbelief. Not that I minded all that much, but it's so soon...~
@894  = ~You kissed me! For no reason!~
@895  = ~(He starts to pull away, but apparently thinks better of it, and returns your kiss with great enthusiasm... and very little skill. After a few moments, however, he starts to follow your lead, and the experience becomes far more pleasant.)~
@896  = ~(He is startled at first, but soon returns your kiss eagerly, lacing his fingers through your hair and drawing you into a close embrace. When you part at last, he sighs happily.)~
@897  = ~My favorite kind of surprise!~
@898  = ~(He is startled at first, but soon returns your kiss eagerly, lacing his fingers through your hair and drawing you into  close embrace.)~
@899  = ~Remind me to continue that discussion later.~
@900  = ~Do you remember our first kiss?~
@901  = ~Do you remember our 'wedding'?~
@902  = ~(You run your fingertip over the scar that was once his left forefinger.)~
@903  = ~Do you remember how angry you got when Durlyle kissed me?~
@904  = ~I was thinking about the first time you tried getting in bed with me.~
@905  = ~Do you ever wish you could do it all over again?~
@906  = ~Just general thoughts, that's all.~
@907  = ~It was right in the middle of the street, as I recall. I was terrified.~
@908  = ~You were so nervous!~
@909  = ~I thought you'd never get around to it.~
@910  = ~You took me completely by surprise.~
@911  = ~Your timing could have been better.~
@912  = ~Do you ever wish you'd done it differently?~
@913  = ~I was in love with someone else at the time, as I recall.~
@914  = ~I had good reason to be. You were the most impressive woman I'd ever beheld. You still are.~
@915  = ~I almost didn't! I couldn't decide whether I wanted to kiss you or faint. Kissing you was far more pleasant.~
@916  = ~It was a surprise for me, too, I'll tell you that.~
@917  = ~It could have been worse, too, but admit it. If the timing hadn't been so bad, would we still remember things so vividly?~
@918  = ~The kiss? No. Everything else...~
@919  = ~I'm glad you came around.~
@920  = ~I woke everyone up in the middle of the night for it!~
@921  = ~Do you still consider us married?~
@922  = ~Are we ever going to have a formal wedding?~
@923  = ~Just as well we never got around to that formal wedding.~
@924  = ~Do you love me just as much now as you did then?~
@925  = ~I still think you were just looking for an excuse to bed me.~
@926  = ~The things we did!~
@927  = ~No. You asked to be released from our vows, so I released you. I'm hoping that one day, you'll be willing to make them again, but I'm content to wait.~
@928  = ~Aye, though I'd still like to have a formal ceremony involving our families and friends someday.~
@929  = ~Not at all. You asked me to release you, so I did.~
@930  = ~We will if you ever decide you want to be married to me... but no pressure. Don't do anything before you're ready.~
@931  = ~Absolutely! I'm looking forward to it.~
@932  = ~Aye, just as well.~
@933  = ~Aye, though I do try to give you the freedom I know you need.~
@934  = ~I love you even more.~
@935  = ~Don't ask me that. Please.~
@936  = ~If that was all it was, I would have dragged you to Beregost as soon as I proposed... and I wouldn't have been willing to forgo the pleasure of your bed when you asked me to release you from our vows.~
@937  = ~If that was all it was, I would have dragged you to Beregost as soon as I proposed.~
@938  = ~Hardly.~
@939  = ~The things we did.~
@940  = ~Hmm?~
@941  = ~I still feel guilty about that.~
@942  = ~Does it still hurt?~
@943  = ~Do you ever resent me for that?~
@944  = ~Can you feel it when I touch the scar?~
@945  = ~I still can't believe you did that.~
@946  = ~Don't, please. It was my decision, and I've never regretted it. Besides, a promise is a promise, and I've still got hope.~
@947  = ~Don't, please. A finger was a small price to pay for the joy you've brought into my life.~
@948  = ~Don't. We all bear scars from our past, and regretting them will only make us miserable.~
@949  = ~Not at all. There was a little phantom pain for a while, but even that went away a long time ago.~
@950  = ~Not at all. It smarted a bit at the time, but I've had worse, and even the memory of it has faded.~
@951  = ~The finger? No, that's long past. Sometimes, there's the pain of something that used to be there and isn't any longer, but that has nothing to do with my hand.~
@952  = ~I didn't resent you then, and I don't resent you now. It was my choice.~
@953  = ~I never resented you. A finger is a small price to pay for the joy you've brought into my life.~
@954  = ~I never resented you. I still have the memory of the happiness we shared, even if it didn't last. A lot of people never have that much.~
@955  = ~Aye, but it's a bit strange. Scars always have an odd little tingle to them. It isn't unpleasant, it's just different.~
@956  = ~I believe it. I would have done anything for you.~
@957  = ~I wanted to kill him.~
@958  = ~You were a lot more jealous back then.~
@959  = ~It was sweet.~
@960  = ~He was just playing.~
@961  = ~That's a little extreme.~
@962  = ~I've had a lot of time to think since then.~
@963  = ~It was foolish. We were leaving, he was staying. I had no reason to be as jealous as I was.~
@964  = ~I know that now, but at the time, I just felt threatened.~
@965  = ~Aye, it was, and foolish, too.~
@966  = ~How could I forget that? I really did get carried away with that one.~
@967  = ~You were never any good at restraint.~
@968  = ~It was all over so fast!~
@969  = ~It was still special.~
@970  = ~You frightened me.~
@971  = ~You stopped when I asked you to, though.~
@972  = ~I'm learning.~
@973  = ~No, I never was.~
@974  = ~I'd better learn, I guess.~
@975  = ~Oh, gods. Our first night together and the one thing you remember is how poor a lover I was. That will teach me humility.~
@976  = ~Aye, that it was.~
@977  = ~Heh. I frightened me, too.~
@978  = ~Aye. How could I not?~
@979  = ~I'd just do it all the same again.~
@980  = ~We all get nostalgic sometimes.~
@981  = ~What can I do for you?~
@982  = ~Would you pick this up for me? It's quite heavy.~
@983  = ~My shoulder is a little sore. Would you mind tightening the laces there in the back?~
@984  = ~I feel so tense! Would you mind rubbing my shoulders?~
@985  = ~My back itches, and I can't reach. Would you mind?~
@986  = ~It's rather personal...~
@987  = ~Nothing, really.~
@988  = ~Certainly! My, this is heavy. I'm glad you asked for help. Back injuries can haunt you for the rest of your life.~
@989  = ~I'd be glad to, though to tell you the truth, you're probably stronger than I am.~
@990  = ~I'll try, but I should warn you that I have absolutely no experience with this.~
@991  = ~You've never laced a gown before?~
@992  = ~It isn't much different from tying your own laces, I'd expect, and you manage that well enough.~
@993  = ~You aren't a virgin, Gavin.~
@994  = ~I have every faith in your ability to tie a knot without getting your fingers stuck in it.~
@995  = ~Oh, never mind.~
@996  = ~Never. The only female I've ever dressed was Lanie before she was old enough to dress herself, and all her clothes just pulled on. But I'll see what I can do.~
@997  = ~Aye, you're probably right. Let's just see what we've got here.~
@998  = ~I might as well be, for all I learned about women from that disaster. Still, I don't suppose that it's that difficult. I'll see what I can do.~
@999  = ~Then you have more confidence than me. Still, how hard can it be?~
@1000 = ~(He tugs on the laces gently... too gently, in fact. It takes a few tries, but eventually, he manages to get your fastenings done up and your gown secured. When he's done, he seems rather pleased with himself.)~
@1001 = ~I'd rather be loosening the laces instead, but I'll do my best.~
@1002 = ~I'm sure you'll find a way to work a grope into that somehow, love.~
@1003 = ~You can do that later... if you want to come to my bed tonight, that is.~
@1004 = ~Is that all you think about, Gavin?~
@1005 = ~I'd rather be loosening yours, as well, but we'll just have to put that off for a while.~
@1006 = ~Only with your permission...~
@1007 = ~I'm always eager to come to your bed, love.~
@1008 = ~No, of course not... well, not *all* I think about, anyway.~
@1009 = ~You have only to say the word, love.~
@1010 = ~(He tugs on the laces gently, but he manages to get your fastenings done up and your gown secured. When he's done, he kisses the back of your neck before releasing you.)~
@1011 = ~I'm sure you'll find a way to work a grope into that somehow.~
@1012 = ~I'm always willing to come to your bed. It's probably my greatest weakness.~
@1013 = ~You have only to say the word.~
@1014 = ~(At first, he seems unsure about where to put his hands, but after a few moments, he seems to realize that you have asked him to help you as a healer, and he settles into that familiar role with obvious relief. He eases your cramped muscles gently, but his touch is firm where it needs to be. When he is done, you feel much better.)~
@1015 = ~(He helps you remove your pack and sets to work on your back with comfortable familiarity. He eases your cramped muscles gently, but his touch is firm where it needs to be. When he is done, you feel much better.)~
@1016 = ~(He seems reluctant at first, but after a few moments, he seems to realize that you have asked him to help you as a healer, and he settles into that familiar role with obvious relief. He eases your cramped muscles gently, but his touch is firm where it needs to be. When he is done, you feel much better.)~
@1017 = ~I just trimmed my nails, but we'll see what we can do.~
@1018 = ~No, of course I don't mind.~
@1019 = ~Alright, but let me know if I'm too rough.~
@1020 = ~(He needs a bit of direction, but once he finds the itchy spot, he sets to work with great enthusiasm.)~
@1021 = ~If there's something I can do for you, I will.~
@1022 = ~I was wondering if you would intercede with someone on my behalf. I've had my eye on -~
@1023 = ~Well, I've been feeling frustrated lately, and I was wondering if you could help me.~
@1024 = ~You've been very attentive to me, but the truth is that I just don't want that kind of friendship with you.~
@1025 = ~It's hard to put it into words.~
@1026 = ~Personal matters are like that, sometimes.~
@1027 = ~I'm no matchmaker, <CHARNAME>. I can't even communicate my own desires, it seems, let alone another's. If there's someone you want to talk to, you're going to have to do it yourself.~
@1028 = ~I... I understand. I realize that you've taken some pains to spare my feelings in this, and I appreciate that.~
@1029 = ~You're feeling frustrated? in what way?~
@1030 = ~You always want to do the right thing, and that's hard for me to accept.~
@1031 = ~You always want to do what you consider to be the right thing, but sometimes, I don't feel the same way about it.~
@1032 = ~I want to be with a man, Gavin.~
@1033 = ~Whatever I do, it never seems to be enough.~
@1034 = ~Everyone is always bickering, Gavin. There's no peace in this party.~
@1035 = ~You're always going to have that when you spend as much time together as we do. We get frustrated over petty little things, and we take it out on each other by joking about our faults, or by saying unkind things to each other, or even by playing little tricks on each other.~
@1036 = ~I know you grew up with Imoen, and that the two of you must have been close, but didn't you ever argue with her for no really good reason? It was the same between my brother Jolun and I.~
@1037 = ~In a lot of ways, we're like a family, <CHARNAME>... in a very loose sense. My point is that we all know each others' weaknesses, and sometimes, when we're feeling threatened or just plain irritable, we take it out on each other because it's safe. It doesn't mean that we don't care about each other. It just means that we know each other well enough to risk it.~
@1038 = ~It does seem that way sometimes, doesn't it? But something is always better than nothing, so as long as we aren't falling behind, we're making progress, even if it's slower than you'd like.~
@1039 = ~You don't have to please me, <CHARNAME>! You're the leader of this group. Please yourself and please your god, and the rest of us can accept it or we can leave.~
@1040 = ~I can't change who I am, <CHARNAME>. I hope you don't really expect me to try.~
@1041 = ~I see. How do you think I could help you?~
@1042 = ~You're a man. Everything works, right?~
@1043 = ~You haven't been with a woman in a long time. You must need some relief yourself.~
@1044 = ~You've been alone for a long time. How do you suppress your urges?~
@1045 = ~On second thought, maybe you can't help me.~
@1046 = ~Aye, but that isn't exactly something I want to talk about.~
@1047 = ~Temporary discomfort aside, I really don't.~
@1048 = ~With great difficulty, apparently.~
@1049 = ~I'm celibate by choice, <CHARNAME>.~
@1050 = ~I've never heard of a celibate Lathandrite.~
@1051 = ~You seem interested in women, though.~
@1052 = ~What would make you choose such a thing?~
@1053 = ~Forget I asked.~
@1054 = ~I'm probably the only one.~
@1055 = ~Aye... more than is good for me.~
@1056 = ~A foolish decision I made a long time ago.~
@1057 = ~We Lathandrites believe that loving, intimate relations are a necessary part of maintaining physical and spiritual health. The union itself satisfies carnal urges, true, but it also fulfils the emotional need to be close to another. This closeness encourages a healthy spirit and a more complete sense of self. We're commanded to be fruitful in mind and body, so the Morninglord obviously does not intend us to reject another's touch.~
@1058 = ~If I abstain, it isn't because I believe it keeps me pure. I do it because I don't want to ruin anyone else's life by confusing lust with love. I did that once, and it ended very badly for everyone involved.~
@1059 = ~I can't tell you what to do, <CHARNAME>. You have needs, and I'm not going to tell you to ignore them, but don't look to me for help there, because I can't give it to you. I hope you understand.~
@1060 = ~Oh, how I enjoy those personal requests! Just say the word, and I'll be there.~
@1061 = ~Say the word, and I'll be there.~
@1062 = ~I'm no dancer, <CHARNAME>. Hells, I can barely walk when other people are looking at me.~
@1063 = ~Please... It really would mean a lot to me.~
@1064 = ~Lots of other people are dancing. No one will even notice us.~
@1065 = ~Just think about it, Gavin. An almost chaste touch accompanied by a sultry glance? How can you resist?~
@1066 = ~Never mind. You're no fun.~
@1067 = ~Why don't I just lie on the floor and pour ale all over myself now? It would be faster.~
@1068 = ~This usually ends badly, <CHARNAME>. Just so you know.~
@1069 = ~Thanks, but I've already humiliated myself at least once already today. I'm practically certain of it.~
@1070 = ~Oh, alright, but I know I'm going to regret this.~
@1071 = ~I don't care if the entire city is up and dancing. Come on, I'll buy you an ale.~
@1072 = ~Gah... you're right. I can't. Lead on, and we'll just have to hope for the best.~
@1073 = ~Thank you for sparing me at least some embarrassment today.~
@1074 = ~(Gavin may have been favored by Lathander, but it soon becomes clear that Tymora bears him no love. The weapon he wears at his belt snags the skirt of a fellow dancer, tearing it with a rip loud enough to silence the dancers, the musicians, and the rest of the tavern. The suddenly bare-legged woman covers her face with her hands and screams.)~
@1075 = ~I beg you, my good woman, forgive me! It was an accident I swear. Here, take my cloak... please don't glare at me like that.~
@1076 = ~We were just leaving, weren't we?~
@1077 = ~(Things begin sedately enough. Gavin seems to be concentrating more on keeping his arms, legs, and equipment from damaging yourself or other dancers than he is on following the steps of the dance, but the occasional mashed toe is a minor inconvenience compared the mayhem he might otherwise cause.)~
@1078 = ~(In an instant, however, the moment of grace is over, and he slips on some spilled ale. He clutches at you wildly and falls, dragging you down on top of him. Your knee catches him squarely in the midsection, and you hear several loud cracking sounds. He groans and curls himself into a ball.)~
@1079 = ~Oh, gods... my ribs...~
@1080 = ~(He takes your hand and leads you to the dance floor with obvious trepidation. The musicians play a stately pavane, however, so if something bad is going to happen, at least it will happen slowly.)~
@1081 = ~(All things considered, the dance does not go badly. At one point, Gavin turned left instead of right and collided with an indignant noblewoman, but a few muttered apologies and a tugged forelock or two smoothed things over with minimal incident, and you complete the dance without injuring anyone in any material way.)~
@1082 = ~(The musicians strike up a reel as you take the floor. The quick beat and lively step might prove an insurmountable obstacle to a dancer of Gavin's ability... or lack thereof... but to your surprise, he relaxes instantly, taking your hand and cheerfully leading you through the complex dance without mishap. By the time the tune ends, you're both panting for air, but Gavin is grinning happily. He leads you to the bar and presses a cool drink into your hand.)~
@1083 = ~They used to play that one every Greengrass back in the Beard. I was only a lad, but gods, how I loved it! I'd be able to swing Reed or Della about and fling them off into the sidelines if I got enough momentum going. Good times, <CHARNAME>, good times.~
@1084 = ~If you're serious, I'd be willing to do it. Next time we stay at an inn, I'll come to your room and we can talk more about it then.~
@1085 = ~(You sing... )~
@1086 = ~(You sing a lively tune you heard in a Beregost tavern.)~
@1087 = ~(You sing a sad song of love and loss.)~
@1088 = ~(You sing a song of unrequited love.)~
@1089 = ~(You sing a bawdy song.)~
@1090 = ~(You sing a battle march.)~
@1091 = ~(You sing a courtly ballad.)~
@1092 = ~(You sing a country tune.)~
@1093 = ~(You sing a song of daring adventure.)~
@1094 = ~(You sing a song of hard lessons and innocence lost.)~
@1095 = ~(You sing a sweet song of happy lovers.)~
@1096 = ~(You sing a riddle song.)~
@1097 = ~(You sing a child's tune.)~
@1098 = ~(You make up a tune on the spot.)~
@1099 = ~(He grins and looks nostalgic.)~
@1100 = ~(He sings along... badly.)~
@1101 = ~(His eyes tear up, but he doesn't interrupt you.)~
@1102 = ~(He sighs and shakes his head.)~
@1103 = ~I think I know that one.~
@1104 = ~(He pretends not to hear.)~
@1105 = ~(He grins sheepishly.)~
@1106 = ~(He hums along... then blushes deeply.)~
@1107 = ~I feel inspired.~
@1108 = ~Is that one 'Gathering Peasecods?'~
@1109 = ~(He looks wistful.)~
@1110 = ~(He smiles... though he looks a bit bored.)~
@1111 = ~(He grins and hums along.)~
@1112 = ~(He joins in for the choruses... and forgets half the words.)~
@1113 = ~Life imitates art?~
@1114 = ~Weren't we in that one?~
@1115 = ~I think I know that one... unfortunately.~
@1116 = ~(He's still smiling moments later.)~
@1117 = ~There's always hope.~
@1118 = ~Interesting harmonies.~
@1119 = ~(He looks a bit baffled.)~
@1120 = ~(He just takes your hand and grins foolishly.)~
@1121 = ~(He sings along.)~
@1122 = ~That was... outstanding.~
@1123 = ~Sorry, but I think you lost me.~
@1124 = ~What did I do to deserve that?~
@1125 = ~You're you.~
@1126 = ~I felt like it.~
@1127 = ~I wanted to see what you felt like in my arms.~
@1128 = ~I like how you feel in my arms.~
@1129 = ~You looked like you needed a hug.~
@1130 = ~Who else would I be?~
@1131 = ~Thanks.~
@1132 = ~And?~
@1133 = ~You feel good.~
@1134 = ~You need a bath.~
@1135 = ~I need more testing to be certain.~
@1136 = ~You're too tall.~
@1137 = ~It was a flimsy excuse to touch you.~
@1138 = ~(gulp) You feel good, too.~
@1139 = ~Sorry, it's the armor. It gets a bit rank on a hot day.~
@1140 = ~I'm not sure I can last through much more 'testing' and maintain my composure.~
@1141 = ~There isn't much I can do about that.~
@1142 = ~Thanks... I think.~
@1143 = ~Maybe I did.~
@1144 = ~That's fortunate, because I like how you feel in mine, as well.~
@1145 = ~(sigh) You like torturing me too, don't you?~
@1146 = ~(He embraces you awkwardly, as if he is unsure where to put his hands.)~
@1147 = ~(His breath catches at your proximity, but he soon relaxes and returns your embrace.)~

@1149 = ~Are you alright? You aren't overtired, are you?~
@1150 = ~Maybe a little.~
@1151 = ~No, it's just that my footing was a little unsteady for a moment.~
@1152 = ~Not at all. I just wanted to hold you.~
@1153 = ~I'm exhausted. Will you carry me?~
@1154 = ~Lean on me for support then... or maybe you should just call a halt?~
@1155 = ~Heh. I know how that goes.~
@1156 = ~You did?~
@1157 = ~Is that so hard to believe?~
@1158 = ~It's a good excuse to touch you.~
@1159 = ~Yes, actually.~
@1160 = ~You wanted to... touch me? I think I need to stand by myself for a while. At least until I stop blushing.~
@1161 = ~I could, but wouldn't it just make more sense to call a halt?~
@1162 = ~(He puts his arms around you, but he seems a bit distracted.)~
@1163 = ~(You take the opportunity to fondle his buttocks.)~
@1164 = ~(You nuzzle him.)~
@1165 = ~(You pinch him.)~
@1166 = ~(You shake your head and let him go.)~
@1167 = ~Hey, now! You're a bit saucy, aren't you?~
@1168 = ~Whoa! You caught me off guard with that one.~
@1169 = ~(He looks at you steadily, then he slowly, very deliberately moves his hand down to your backside.) That game is meant for two.~
@1170 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, they're still there.~
@1171 = ~(He kisses the top of your head.)~
@1172 = ~(He tightens his embrace and sighs.)~
@1173 = ~(He raises your lips to his and kisses you softly.)~
@1174 = ~Ow! Sorry, I was trying to recall whether I remembered to wash out my socks.~
@1175 = ~What was that for?~
@1176 = ~You need to pay more attention.~
@1177 = ~Mere whim.~
@1178 = ~When was the last time you kissed me?~
@1179 = ~Maybe I do.~
@1180 = ~Oh? Well, so's this. (He pinches you back.)~
@1181 = ~Not too long... er... that's the wrong answer, isn't it?~
@1182 = ~Sorry, I'm feeling a bit off today.~
@1183 = ~(He sweeps your hair away from your face and kisses your cheek.)~
@1184 = ~Mmm. Feels good.~
@1185 = ~(He embraces you warmly.)~
@1186 = ~Was there something you wanted?~
@1187 = ~Just a hug.~
@1188 = ~A kiss would be nice.~
@1189 = ~(He kisses you briefly, then buries his face in your hair, breathing your fragrance.)~
@1190 = ~You'll have to wait until later, I'm afraid.~
@1191 = ~I'll be ready.~
@1192 = ~I didn't mean now!~
@1193 = ~We'll see. I might change my mind.~
@1194 = ~Tonight, then.~
@1195 = ~If so, you can send me away.~
@1196 = ~(He holds you close and kisses your lips.)~
@1197 = ~There goes my concentration for a while.~
@1198 = ~I love the way you feel in my arms.~
@1199 = ~(sigh) This shouldn't feel so good.~
@1200 = ~(He blushes, but looks very pleased.)~
@1201 = ~Thrgk... Ahem. Thank you.~
@1202 = ~(As you lean closer, he turns his head, poking you with his nose.)~
@1203 = ~Sorry about that.~
@1204 = ~(He raises his hand to scratch his ear at precisely the wrong time and winds up striking the underside of your chin.)~
@1205 = ~Oh! I am so sorry!~
@1206 = ~(He turns his head and you wind up kissing him squarely on the lips. He blinks in surprise for a moment or two, then grins sheepishly.)~
@1207 = ~I don't know if that's what you intended, but I certainly enjoyed it.~
@1208 = ~(He puts his hand to his cheek, looking bemused, but happy.)~
@1209 = ~(He kisses your cheek in return.)~
@1210 = ~(He moves his head and you wind up kissing his hair.)~
@1211 = ~(He takes your hand and kisses it.)~
@1212 = ~(As you start to withdraw, he stops you, and brings your lips to his for a real kiss.)~
@1213 = ~(He holds his hand to his cheek and sighs happily.)~
@1214 = ~I think I need another one of those. The other side feels jealous.~
@1215 = ~(He smooths your hair away from your face and strokes your cheek.)~
@1216 = ~You've done something naughty and you don't want me to get angry, haven't you?~
@1217 = ~Hmm. That was rather nice.~
@1218 = ~You want something, don't you?~
@1219 = ~That was unexpected! Pleasant, but quite a surprise!~
@1220 = ~(He hesitates for a moment, but returns your kiss eagerly.)~
@1221 = ~(When your lips part, he takes your face in his hands and kisses your forehead.)~
@1222 = ~(As you start to draw away, his arms tighten around you. He brings your lips to his and kisses you softly.)~
@1223 = ~(Your display of affection seems to have upset his equilibrium somehow, because when he stops kissing you and begins walking again, he lurches and staggers a bit before catching himself.)~
@1224 = ~(At the first touch of your lips, you feel Gavin falter, as if his knees buckled for a moment. When you part, his face is very, very red.)~
@1225 = ~(Your gesture surprises him and he jumps backward, catching his heel. His arms flail for a moment, but he still winds up on his backside.)~
@1226 = ~Oh! Sorry, <CHARNAME>, I wasn't ready. Can we do that again?~
@1227 = ~I'll give you fifty or sixty years to stop doing that.~
@1228 = ~(He puts his arms around you and holds you close.)~
@1229 = ~(He returns your kiss enthusiastically.)~
@1230 = ~(Perhaps you intended nothing more than a quick peck, but Gavin has other ideas. When you start to pull away from him, his arms close more tightly around you, and he kisses you passionately.)~
@1231 = ~I love it when you do that.~
@1232 = ~Now I'll be walking around with a silly grin on my face for the rest of the day!~
@1233 = ~Mmmm. We're going to have to do some more of this later...~
@1234 = ~(When your lips part at last, he lays your head against his shoulder and rests his cheek against your hair. He holds you quietly for several moments, then lets you go with a kiss to your forehead.)~
@1235 = ~Aren't you worried about making someone jealous?~
@1236 = ~(He returns your kiss, but he seems a bit distracted.)~
@1237 = ~(He becomes strangely passive while you kiss him, obviously enjoying the attention, but not really returning your embrace.)~
@1238 = ~(When you start to pull away from him, he stops you, and kisses you a second time, even more passionately than before.)~
@1239 = ~Mmmm. That feels good...~
@1240 = ~Let's save some of those for later, maybe...~
@1241 = ~There are times I wish it was possible to start over.~
@1242 = ~I never used to understand how something could hurt but still feel good.~
@1243 = ~(He looks startled, but pleased.)~
@1244 = ~(He turns and smiles at you, squeezing your fingers gently.)~
@1245 = ~(He looks puzzled, but he doesn't drop your hand.)~
@1246 = ~(He drops your hand for a moment, hastily rubs his palm against his thigh, then sheepishly takes your hand again.)~
@1247 = ~(He brings your fingertips to his lips to kiss them, then walks hand in hand with you, smiling widely.)~
@1248 = ~(His fingers close protectively around yours.)~
@1249 = ~(He holds your hand lightly in his, idly swinging it as you walk.)~
@1250 = ~(He sighs happily and presses your fingers lightly.)~
@1251 = ~(He sighs, but he doesn't let go of your hand.)~
@1252 = ~(He absentmindedly brings your hand to his mouth and kisses it.)~
@1253 = ~(He shakes his head, but he lets you hold his hand as long as you like.)~
@1254 = ~(He squeezes your fingers briefly, then releases them.)~
@1255 = ~(You adjust your clothing and lean toward Gavin, treating him to a clear view of your cleavage.)~
@1256 = ~(You turn away from Gavin slightly and bring one knee forward, letting Gavin see your legs from their best angle.)~
@1257 = ~(You pretend to bend over to pick something up off the ground, allowing Gavin to admire your bottom.)~
@1258 = ~(You brush your hair up off your face, exposing the lines of your neck and jaw.)~
@1259 = ~(You decide against it.)~
@1260 = ~(gulp) Excuse me, did you say something?~
@1261 = ~(His eyes open wide and his Adam's apple bobs in his throat. He turns away, blushing furiously.)~
@1262 = ~(His breath catches and he stares for a moment. He raises his gaze to your face, his cheeks flaming. His lips move as if he were trying to say something, but he quickly gives up and turns away.)~
@1263 = ~Oh! I beg your pardon! I... er... didn't mean to stare...~
@1264 = ~Are you tempting me?~
@1265 = ~That depends. Are you temptable?~
@1266 = ~Most definitely.~
@1267 = ~Who, me?~
@1268 = ~I seem to have my libido under control, at the moment.~
@1269 = ~More than I'd like to admit.~
@1270 = ~Only to a point.~
@1271 = ~(He reaches out and cautiously widens the gap in your clothing slightly.) Your move.~
@1272 = ~You're a cruel woman, making me want something I can't have.~
@1273 = ~Then you'd better loosen your chemise a little more. I can barely see the cleft between your breasts.~
@1274 = ~I wrong you, <CHARNAME>. Clearly, you are too innocent to lead a man on like that.~
@1275 = ~No, you would never do anything like that.~
@1276 = ~I think I'd better go stand somewhere else.~
@1277 = ~(He begins to crane his neck for a better view, but catches himself. He turns away, muttering what sounds like vitriolic self-reproach.)~
@1278 = ~Well, that certainly got my attention.~
@1279 = ~It seems to be getting rather warm here.~
@1280 = ~Careful, love. You never know what might happen if you put that kind of temptation in front of me.~
@1281 = ~If you're offering me pillows, I'll take two.~
@1282 = ~I'd like another look at that later, if you're up for it.~
@1283 = ~Very nice.~
@1284 = ~(You succeed in attracting his attention, but the distraction proves too great. He staggers when his heel catches on the ground, though he manages to remain standing.)~
@1285 = ~(You catch him glancing surreptitiously at your legs.)~
@1286 = ~One of these days, you're going to have to let me sketch you. Your proportions are really quite inspiring.~
@1287 = ~Can I get that for you? Oh, wait... there's nothing there. How... odd.~
@1288 = ~(You glance over your shoulder just in time to see Gavin's face set in a look of silent admiration.)~
@1289 = ~(You turn at the sound of a muffled crash and see Gavin sprawled on the ground, one ankle hooked around the opposite heel.)~
@1290 = ~(His gaze lingers on your profile, taking in the graceful line of your jaw and throat.)~
@1291 = ~Wars have been fought for the sake of a neck like that.~
@1292 = ~(He reaches out and runs one reverent fingertip along your jaw before sighing and looking away.)~
@1293 = ~(He blushes, but he smiles faintly.)~
@1294 = ~(He looks flustered for a few moments, but he timidly covers your hand with his free one and squeezes it lightly, a shy smile on his lips.)~
@1295 = ~(He stands up a little straighter, and his chest swells with new-found confidence.)~
@1296 = ~(The distraction causes him to lose his balance and he staggers. He recovers almost instantly, but his face is flaming.)~
@1297 = ~Are you alright?~
@1298 = ~I like walking arm in arm with someone.~
@1299 = ~I'm fine, but you could put your arm around me, if you wanted.~
@1300 = ~I'm a little tired.~
@1301 = ~You don't mind, do you?~
@1302 = ~The ground is a little uneven through here.~
@1303 = ~Oh... I like it, too.~
@1304 = ~I would like that, but I would not want you to think me forward.~
@1305 = ~Lean on my arm, then... or maybe you would be better off calling a halt? We can't have you exhausting yourself.~
@1306 = ~No, not at all!~
@1307 = ~If you're counting on me to steady you, I'm afraid that you might be in for a bit of a let-down. I tend to trip a lot.~
@1308 = ~(He covers your hand with his and grins.)~
@1309 = ~(He lurches sideways, as if your touch startled him.)~
@1310 = ~(His chest swells with pride and he beams at you, obviously delighted by your gesture.)~
@1311 = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>. I could get used to this.~
@1312 = ~I still can't believe how lucky I am to have you.~
@1313 = ~(He grins broadly, covering your hand with his.)~
@1314 = ~(He leans in and kisses you softly on the cheek.)~
@1315 = ~I don't know if I'll ever understand why you chose me, but I'll always be glad you did.~
@1316 = ~(He shakes his head and sighs, but he does not remove your hand.)~
@1317 = ~(He looks down at the hand you have placed on his arm and smiles sadly.)~
@1318 = ~(He pats your hand and smiles.)~
@1319 = ~Did you want something?~
@1320 = ~I just felt like touching you.~
@1321 = ~You need to wake up. You were looking a little distracted.~
@1322 = ~I want some attention.~
@1323 = ~No, I just felt like being close to you.~
@1324 = ~Touch away!~
@1325 = ~Maybe I am.~
@1326 = ~(He stops, turns you to face him, and embraces you closely.)~
@1327 = ~(He leans toward you and kisses you on the cheek.)~
@1328 = ~(You creep up behind Gavin and stroke the back of his neck ever so lightly, as if a spider were walking across his skin.)~
@1329 = ~(You stroke his hand.)~
@1330 = ~(You touch Gavin's face.)~
@1331 = ~(You ease his collar away from his neck and run your finger seductively along his upper chest.)~
@1332 = ~(You stroke his backside.)~
@1333 = ~(You run your hand up the inside of his thigh.)~
@1334 = ~(You leave him alone.)~
@1335 = ~(He blanches and swats frantically at his neck.)~
@1336 = ~(He squeals out loud, yanks his helmet off, and paws at his hair and neck, obviously trying to dislodge your 'spider.')~
@1337 = ~(He bats at his neck, emitting muffled hissing noises.)~
@1338 = ~(He throws his helmet to the ground and vigorously brushes off his neck and shoulders. To your surprise, a fat, hairy spider *does* fall off of him. He stares at it in horror for a moment, stomps on it, then spins around, dropping to his hands and knees and heaving violently.)~
@1339 = ~I'm sorry. Was I walking too close to you?~
@1340 = ~No, it was just an accident.~
@1341 = ~You have nice hands.~
@1342 = ~May I see your hand for a moment?~
@1343 = ~Maybe once.~
@1344 = ~If you like.~
@1345 = ~(You turn his hand over and trace the lines on his palm.)~
@1346 = ~(You stroke the back of his hand against your cheek.)~
@1347 = ~(You raise his hand to your mouth and suck on one of his fingers.)~
@1348 = ~(You take his hand in both of yours and just hold it for a few moments.)~
@1349 = ~(You wrap his fingers around your hand.)~
@1350 = ~That tickles!~
@1351 = ~(At first, he allows it, but he soon begins to look uncomfortable. After a few more heartbeats, he shakes his head and takes his hand away.)~
@1352 = ~(His breath catches and he looks at you intently, but makes no other move. When you release his hand at last, he looks relieved.)~
@1353 = ~(He flinches slightly at your touch.)~
@1354 = ~(He regards you steadily for a moment, then slowly closes his fingers around your hand.)~
@1355 = ~(He shivers appreciatively at your touch.)~
@1356 = ~If you're trying to distract me, it's working.~
@1357 = ~<CHARNAME>... I'd better take my hand back now.~
@1358 = ~(He closes his eyes for a moment, obviously savoring the contact.)~
@1359 = ~Mmmm. That feels good.~
@1360 = ~Er... should we be doing this here?~
@1361 = ~(He closes his hand around yours and leans in to kiss your cheek.)~
@1362 = ~(He looks puzzled, but pleased.)~
@1363 = ~(He sighs happily and smiles.)~
@1364 = ~(When you lower his hand, he raises it again and strokes your cheek.)~
@1365 = ~<CHARNAME>! I... excuse me. I just remembered that I needed to check something in my pack. Now.~
@1366 = ~Oh, gods... don't do that, <CHARNAME>... please...~
@1367 = ~(His eyes widen and he stares at you, his blush slowly rising in his cheeks.)~
@1368 = ~Do you have any idea how suggestive that is?~
@1369 = ~<CHARNAME>... please... I don't know how much of that my composure can take.~
@1370 = ~(He snatches his hand away, blushing to his hairline.)~
@1371 = ~You do know how to torture a man, don't you?~
@1372 = ~Easy, <CHARNAME>. This isn't the best time to follow up on that kind of play.~
@1373 = ~(He closes his eyes and savors the sensation, though his chest heaves with the effort of maintaining his composure.)~
@1374 = ~(When you release his hand, he raises it and strokes your cheek.)~
@1375 = ~(He closes your hand in his and holds it for several heartbeats.)~
@1376 = ~(He raises your hand to his lips and kisses it.)~
@1377 = ~(He squeezes your hand lightly and smiles.)~
@1378 = ~(He shakes his head and releases your hand.)~
@1379 = ~Have I got dirt on my face?~
@1380 = ~Yes. Hold still and I'll get it off.~
@1381 = ~You're getting freckles.~
@1382 = ~No, Gavin, it's a sign of affection.~
@1383 = ~You're getting a little stubbly.~
@1384 = ~(He stands patiently while you stroke his face, though he begins to look uncomfortable after a few moments.)~
@1385 = ~It's freckles or sunburn, I'm afraid. Sometimes, both.~
@1386 = ~(blushing scarlet) Oh... thank you.~
@1387 = ~I'll have to shave when we stop for the day.~
@1388 = ~(He looks confused, but says nothing.)~
@1389 = ~You had an eyelash stuck to your cheek.~
@1390 = ~Your cheek feels good. I wonder how it would feel next to mine...~
@1391 = ~Would you let me kiss you?~
@1392 = ~You have a kind face.~
@1393 = ~Would you kiss me?~
@1394 = ~Ah. Thank you.~
@1395 = ~Probably too good... too good for me to endure, that is.~
@1396 = ~Uh... I would, but then I'd blush... and get clumsy. And then I'd step in a hole or trip over something, and you'd laugh at me, and my manly pride would never recover. You wouldn't want that on your conscience, would you?~
@1397 = ~I get that a lot.~
@1398 = ~Ooh! Sorry, you startled me.~
@1399 = ~(He looks baffled for a moment, but says nothing. His eyes follow you as you turn away.)~
@1400 = ~Yes?~
@1401 = ~Why don't you grow a beard?~
@1402 = ~You look a little pale.~
@1403 = ~Your face is dirty.~
@1404 = ~Your face feels soft.~
@1405 = ~May I have a kiss?~
@1406 = ~I like your face.~
@1407 = ~It doesn't grow in very well... and it itches when it gets too long.~
@1408 = ~I must not be getting enough exercise.~
@1409 = ~(He scrubs at his face with his hand, smearing a wide streak of grime across his cheek.)~
@1410 = ~Er... thanks. You did mean that as a compliment... I hope.~
@1411 = ~I don't know...~
@1412 = ~Alright...~
@1413 = ~We aren't alone...~
@1414 = ~(giggle) Don't mind me!~
@1415 = ~But, my lady! Surely you do not desire a... caress... from this lout!~
@1416 = ~Bah. I care not.~
@1417 = ~I would pay no heed to whatever you do.~
@1418 = ~Have you cretins no better amusements?~
@1419 = ~The time we mortals dance upon the plane is fleeting. Seize it while you may!~
@1420 = ~Aw, how cute!~
@1421 = ~If you have nothing better to do with your lips, cleric, I suggest praying. You need all the divine assistance you can get.~
@1422 = ~Don't stop on my account!~
@1423 = ~As you no doubt desire privacy, I shall avert my gaze.~
@1424 = ~Har, har! There ye go, lad! Give her all ye got!~
@1425 = ~I find that my attention is needed elsewhere for several moments.~
@1426 = ~Go on, Boo won't mind.~
@1427 = ~Oh, don't mind me!~
@1428 = ~Whatever.~
@1429 = ~Spare me this display of rivvil sentimentality!~

@1432 = ~Ah, hells...~
@1433 = ~(He embraces you hesitantly, turning you away from the others, then gently lifts your chin with one trembling hand. His lips brush yours and he steps away, his face very, very red.)~
@1434 = ~(He throws his arms around you, then raises your lips to his. He kisses you soundly, but breaks the embrace before too many heartbeats pass. He looks slightly embarrassed, but he smiles despite himself.)~
@1435 = ~(He embraces you warmly, cradling your chin in his hand. He kisses you deeply, stopping only when the muffled sighs and throat clearings of your companions becomes too frequent to ignore.)~
@1436 = ~(He shrugs and puts his arms around you. Despite his initial indifference, however, he kisses you quite passionately, and by the time you finally pull away from him, he is breathing very heavily indeed.)~
@1437 = ~That's something I don't hear often.~
@1438 = ~(He reaches out and strokes your cheek in return.)~
@1439 = ~(He smiles shyly, though he doesn't quite meet your gaze.)~
@1440 = ~(He catches your hand in his and kisses it.)~
@1441 = ~Yes, love?~
@1442 = ~You have a sweet face.~
@1443 = ~Hold still, you've got a smear of dirt right across your cheek.~
@1444 = ~I think you've been getting too much sun. You're a little pink.~
@1445 = ~Is that a wrinkle I see?~
@1446 = ~I just wanted to touch you.~
@1447 = ~I love the way your skin feels when you're freshly shaved.~
@1448 = ~I'm glad it pleases you.~
@1449 = ~If ever I questioned whether you had the makings of a good wife, I would doubt it no longer! You'll keep me tidy and presentable, won't you, love?~
@1450 = ~Ah, yes, that does happen, doesn't it?~
@1451 = ~It could be. This will be my thirtieth summer, and I've spent my whole life out of doors.~
@1452 = ~I am always happy to be touched by you, love.~
@1453 = ~Then I shall have to shave twice a day!~
@1454 = ~(He catches your hand and gently uncurls you fingers. He brings your hand to his lips and gently kisses your palm.)~
@1455 = ~(He catches your hand in his and draws you in for a kiss.)~
@1456 = ~Sweet, beloved <CHARNAME>...~
@1457 = ~Yes? Was there something you wanted?~
@1458 = ~When was the last time you shaved?~
@1459 = ~Will you come to my bed later?~
@1460 = ~Yesterday, I think.~

@1464 = ~(He closes his eyes for a moment and sighs.)~
@1465 = ~(He catches your hand and looks at it for a few heartbeats, then raises it to his lips and kisses it.)~
@1466 = ~(His breath catches and he leaps away from you, obviously startled.)~
@1467 = ~(gulp) Y-yes... ?~
@1468 = ~Excuse me, <CHARNAME>, I usually like the attention, but that's a little personal...~
@1469 = ~(His eyes open wide and he freezes. He relaxes after a heartbeat or two... and after a few deep, steadying breaths.)~
@1470 = ~Feeling a little naughty, are we?~
@1471 = ~(He catches your hand in his and presses it lightly to his chest.)~
@1472 = ~(He inhales sharply, then lets it out slowly as your finger completes its course. He raises his eyes to meet yours. His cheeks are crimson, but his gaze is steady.)~
@1473 = ~(gulp) <CHARNAME>... what you're doing is making it rather difficult for me to maintain my composure.~
@1474 = ~(His arm snakes around your waist and he draws you close. He buries his face in your hair and breathes deeply. At last, he releases you, sighing.)~
@1475 = ~My I do the same to you?~
@1476 = ~(He seizes your hand and kisses it before pressing it against his heart.)~
@1477 = ~Don't stop there, <CHARNAME>. You can have the rest for the asking.~
@1478 = ~(He draws a quick breath and stares at you wide-eyed, temporarily dumbstruck.)~

@1480 = ~Ooh! <CHARNAME>... did you just... oh my.~
@1481 = ~(The armor Gavin wears prevents you from getting much of a feel, but Gavin, at least, seems to have noticed. He stops suddenly, a very surprised look on his face.)~

@1490 = ~(gulp) I see.~
@1491 = ~A bit, aye.~
@1492 = ~You haven't... I'm just a bit startled.~
@1493 = ~(Your movement apparently causes the links of Gavin's armor to pinch him. He jumps, and tries to look around to his backside to see what's causing his armor to bind.)~

@1501 = ~Well, I did... but it isn't something I really want to encourage, if you know what I mean.~
@1502 = ~No, I don't think I could. Not without a really cold lake to jump into afterward.~
@1503 = ~Um... it's still a bit more forward than I'm used to.~
@1504 = ~No, but that is a bit... aggressive.~
@1505 = ~Oh... <CHARNAME>!~
@1506 = ~(Gavin tentatively reaches out and fondles your backside in return... though his cheeks are flaming.)~
@1507 = ~You aren't going to be able to feel much through the armor, you know.~

@1509 = ~Keep that up and people might get the wrong idea.~
@1510 = ~Are you trying to molest me?~
@1511 = ~Would you like me to?~
@1512 = ~No, I just wanted to see what your backside felt like.~
@1513 = ~Actually, I'm trying to make you blush.~
@1514 = ~Who me?~
@1515 = ~Well, yes... but this isn't exactly the time or the place.~
@1516 = ~Now you know.~
@1517 = ~I'm sure it's working.~

@1520 = ~(At first, Gavin puts his arm around your waist, but then he slowly, and very deliberately, drops his hand to stroke your rear end in return.)~
@1521 = ~You might like that better without the armor.~
@1522 = ~Keep that up and I'll stand here all day!~
@1523 = ~It's a good thing this armor is so thick, or I'd be turning pretty red right about now.~

@1530 = ~(His breath catches and he jumps several feet backward.)~

@1532 = ~(His breath catches and he flinches, but he allows your touch... for a moment or two, anyway.)~
@1533 = ~That's a bit forward, don't you think?~
@1534 = ~(Gavin might not be the most bulky of men, but his legs, at least, are powerfully built.)~
@1535 = ~How far were you planning on taking that?~
@1536 = ~How far will you let me?~
@1537 = ~All the way to the top.~
@1538 = ~Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.~
@1539 = ~You've gone far enough.~
@1540 = ~Don't. Please.~
@1541 = ~Well, you have.~
@1542 = ~You haven't, but I'd still be more comfortable if you left it at that.~
@1543 = ~(His breathing deepens and his eyes close as you stroke his thigh. After a moment or two, a grimmace crosses his face.) Sorry, love, but you'd better stop.~
@1544 = ~(His breathing deepens and his eyes close as you stroke his thigh. After a moment or two, a grimmace crosses his face.) That's about enough of that.~
@1545 = ~Oh, gods... you're driving me wild with that.~
@1546 = ~Keep that up much longer and I'm going to need a cold bath to sit in.~
@1547 = ~I hope you'll let me return the favor once we're alone.~
@1548 = ~Mmm. That feels wonderful.~
@1549 = ~You're the first person that's ever done that. Thank you.~
@1550 = ~Mmm. I'm yours. Oh, that's right, I already am.~
@1551 = ~Do you have any idea how good that feels?~
@1552 = ~You're too good to me.~
@1553 = ~Name your reward and it's yours.~
@1554 = ~That's very kind of you.~

@1557 = ~<CHARNAME>!!!~
@1558 = ~If a certain naughty girl wants to step away from the others for a while, you have only to ask.~

@1560 = ~Easy there! You don't want to be hitting that too hard.~
@1561 = ~Whoa! Watch the hands!~
@1562 = ~You don't have to try that hard, you know.~
@1563 = ~What in the nine hells do you think you're doing?~
@1564 = ~Everything is wrong, Gavin! I never wanted any of this!~
@1565 = ~I'm so alone!~
@1566 = ~I'll be alright.~
@1567 = ~You're strong, <CHARNAME>. After everything you've already overcome, I know you'll be able to get through this.~
@1568 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>... I wish I knew what to say.~
@1569 = ~(He embraces you awkwardly and pats your shoulder.)~
@1570 = ~(You fling your arms around his neck and sob into his chest.)~
@1571 = ~(You pull away from him, sniffing loudly and blinking back your tears.)~
@1572 = ~(You burst into tears, break his embrace, and run away from him.)~
@1573 = ~(You slide your hands down his back, sneaking a good feel of his backside in the process.)~
@1574 = ~I'll be alright, I just needed a moment to collect myself.~
@1575 = ~There's nothing you can do. I've got to face this alone. I'm always alone.~
@1576 = ~There, there... it will all be alright, you'll see.~
@1577 = ~There's the <CHARNAME> I know! We'll get through this, I swear.~
@1578 = ~<CHARNAME>! Wait! I'm sorry! Was it something I said?~
@1579 = ~(He flinches, but he allows your touch. Your audacity is rewarded with the opportunity to explore a firm, well-rounded pair of buttocks.)~
@1580 = ~Take as long as you need.~
@1581 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, that isn't true. I'll help you however I am able.~
@1582 = ~(He folds you into his arms, easing your head to rest against his shoulder.)~
@1583 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I know this is hard on you. Let it out, if you need to.~
@1584 = ~<CHARNAME>, wait! Tell me what's wrong! Maybe I can help!~
@1585 = ~(His breath catches, but he makes no move to break away from you. After a few moments of your caress, however, his composure begins to waver, and he tears himself away.)~
@1586 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I know I've got no right to take advantage of your distress, but I'm only human. Your touch was a little more... familiar than I can comfortably endure.~
@1587 = ~Take as long as you need, <CHARNAME>. I won't let you go.~
@1588 = ~You aren't alone. You've got me... and the others, of course. We'll all get through this together.~
@1589 = ~(He embraces you tightly, easing your head to rest against his shoulder.)~
@1590 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I know this is hard on you, but you're stronger than this. We can get through this together.~
@1591 = ~There's my fearless <CHARNAME>!~
@1592 = ~<CHARNAME>, wait! You know there's nothing we can't talk about! I'll help you get through this, if you'll let me!~
@1593 = ~(At first, his only reaction is to draw you closer. After a few moments of your attention, however, he pulls away slightly.)~
@1594 = ~You're upset, love, and I'll hold you as long as you need me to, but if you keep touching me like that, I'm going to have a hard time keeping myself focused on comforting you.~
@1595 = ~Take as long as you need, <CHARNAME>. I won't let you go... ever.~
@1596 = ~Not while I'm still living, you won't! We're in this together, love, every step of the way.~
@1597 = ~(He embraces you awkwardly, letting your head rest against his shoulder.)~
@1598 = ~Come on, <CHARNAME>, you're tougher than this. You can do it.~
@1599 = ~There's the fearless <CHARNAME> I know!~
@1600 = ~<CHARNAME>, wait! Oh, never mind...~
@1601 = ~If all you wanted was a fistfull of ass, you could have just asked.~
@1602 = ~Take as long as you need...~
@1603 = ~We all have to live with the choices we make.~
@1604 = ~(Few would ever call Gavin handsome, but his face is kind.)~
@1605 = ~(His complexion is fair and a bit sunburned, with a spattering of freckles across his cheeks and forehead.)~
@1606 = ~(The fairness of his skin and the angularity of his features suggest the possibility of Luskan blood somewhere in his ancestry, but his hair and eyes are dark.)~
@1607 = ~(His face seems a little more gaunt than usual, with shadows under his eyes.)~
@1608 = ~(Gavin is tall, even for a human, with prominent elbows and knees.)~
@1609 = ~(Nature seems to have intended Gavin to be a heavier man than he is at present. He looks a bit wiry, but he seems healthy enough, and his gait is lively.)~
@1610 = ~(He yawns and stretches, accidentally poking one of his companions.)~
@1611 = ~(As usual, his hair and clothing are clean, but rather disheveled.)~
@1612 = ~<CHARNAME>, I... excuse me.~
@1613 = ~(He looks around to see who has attracted your attention, then reddens once he realizes that you are looking at him. He turns away, but you cannot help but notice how pleased he looks.)~
@1614 = ~(His blush starts on his cheeks, but rapidly expands to include his face, ears, and neck.)~
@1615 = ~(He smiles cordially, but surreptitiously checks to be sure that he has fastened all his laces.)~
@1616 = ~(Gavin shakes his head and turns away.)~
@1617 = ~What odd tastes you have.~
@1618 = ~(Gavin looks baffled, but he says nothing.)~
@1619 = ~(Gavin sighs dejectedly and turns away.)~
@1620 = ~<CHARNAME>, here, I think you dropped something.~
@1621 = ~So, Anomen, how's that rash coming along?~
@1622 = ~What rash?~
@1623 = ~You know...~
@1624 = ~You must be mistaken. My skin is perfectly unblemished.~
@1625 = ~Damn. Some people have all the luck.~
@1626 = ~Could I have a word with you, <CHARNAME>?~
@1627 = ~She obviously has nothing to say to you, or she would have approached you first.~
@1628 = ~(sigh) Aye, true enough.~
@1629 = ~(Anomen revels in the attention, but Gavin is obviously seething.)~
@1630 = ~You and Anomen seem to be rather... close.~
@1631 = ~(Gavin's face reddens, his hands clench into fists, and he stomps off, muttering to himself.)~
@1632 = ~(Gavin sweeps you into his arms, tilts your head back, and kisses you passionately... but you cannot help noticing that his eyes remain open and his gaze remains fixed on Anomen.)~
@1633 = ~So, it's Anomen's turn now, is it?~
@1634 = ~Here's a hint, <CHARNAME>. All that time he spends polishing his armor? It's a substitute for something else.~
@1635 = ~(Gavin shrugs and walks away.)~
@1636 = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>. Anomen takes these things very seriously.~
@1637 = ~This is rather... unseemly.~
@1638 = ~If you are trying to excite jealousy from certain quarters, you might be better off directing your attention elsewhere.~
@1639 = ~<CHARNAME>, for mercy's sake, leave the poor man alone.~
@1640 = ~I don't know what you're after, <CHARNAME>, but you'll have no luck with me.~
@1641 = ~Who's the object of this attention, <CHARNAME>? Gavin or me?~
@1642 = ~At once.~
@1643 = ~You mean my family in Ulgoth's Beard, right? Because you already know about Lanie, and she's the only other family I've got.~
@1644 = ~What is Ulgoth's Beard like?~
@1645 = ~What are your parents like?~
@1646 = ~How about your brothers and sisters?~
@1647 = ~Do you miss them?~
@1648 = ~Ulgoth's Beard is more of a village, really. There aren't even any good roads between it and Baldur's Gate.~
@1649 = ~It lies half a day north of Baldur's Gate, on the north bank of the Chionthar River, overlooking the coast of the Sea of Swords... and I really do mean overlooking it. The village is at the top of a cliff.~
@1650 = ~It's an odd name, though. What's the story behind it?~
@1651 = ~What do people do there?~
@1652 = ~Did you have a lot of friends, growing up?~
@1653 = ~What made you leave it?~
@1654 = ~Ulgoth's Beard is known for its beacon. Whenever potentially hostile ships are sighted on the Sea of Swords, the beacon is lit, and Baldur's Gate gets at least half a day's warning of any potential attacks.~
@1655 = ~The village got its name because the beacon was said to be so bright that it was said to have singed the whiskers of Ulgoth, a legendary pirate.~
@1656 = ~There isn't much to do there, really. The closest thing it has to a tavern is this one house out on the harbor. The landlord there has it set up as a public house of sorts, so folks go there at the end of the day for a pint of ale and a bit of gossip.~
@1657 = ~If you're asking what they do for a living, it's about what you would expect in a coastal village. You have fishermen and farmers, and a few craftsmen. My father made sails, though my brother Gordon has mostly taken over the business, now.~
@1658 = ~My younger brother Jolun was probably my closest friend, but there was also Calahan, Hamish, and a few others. Most families in the village had at least a few children, though there were probably only about a dozen families in the village, all told.~
@1659 = ~In short, I became a Dawnbringer. In my twelfth summer, my brother Jolun broke his leg in a fall from the cliff, and I was able to stop the bleeding until the village priest could tend it. Since I follow Lathander and the village priest venerated Chauntea, I was sent to study at the Song of the Morning in Beregost.~
@1660 = ~My parents are Darlos and Evie. Dad used to be a sailmaker, but he's getting older and he's mostly deaf, so my brother Gordon runs the business now. My mother is a midwife. She's older, too, of course, but she'd never give that up. She loves babies too much.~
@1661 = ~Well, I've got four, so I hope you're patient. The two oldest, Gordon and Della, settled down. Both have large families, now. Gordon runs my father's sailmaking business and Della keeps the books for him and sells herbs.~
@1662 = ~My other sister, Reed, became a mage. She's never exactly said that she's an adventurer, but I know she works closely with some paladins. Jolun, my younger brother, is an artist. He's usually in some kind of trouble, so it's probably best not to ask him what he gets up to.~
@1663 = ~Yes and no. I always enjoy visiting them, but I've got my own life now. It's like that, I guess. I write them when I remember, but that probably isn't as often as my mother would like.~
@1664 = ~You mean my family in Ulgoth's Beard? I thought you knew all about them.~
@1665 = ~What about Lanie?~
@1666 = ~I hate to sound petty, but you give that child altogether too much of your attention.~
@1667 = ~When will you need to visit her again?~
@1668 = ~I want to reassure myself that your attention is focused on the present task, not back at the Temple of Oghma with her.~
@1669 = ~Have you made provisions for her, if something happens to you?~
@1670 = ~Sometimes, I wonder if you even know her. You've been separated from her for most of her life.~
@1671 = ~You do have options, you know. You could give her over to the temple, and you'd never have to think of her again.~
@1672 = ~There are people out there that would pay good gold for a girl like her.~
@1673 = ~So much of your heart is given to her, I sometimes wonder if there's room for anyone else.~
@1674 = ~She's only a child, <CHARNAME>. Her world is small, and contains nothing but parents, teachers, and maybe a few playmates. Taking away any of those things would be cruel.~
@1675 = ~Don't worry, though. I won't neglect my duties.~
@1676 = ~I'll let you know when it's time.~
@1677 = ~I am aware of my obligations, <CHARNAME>... all of them.~
@1678 = ~If I die, I'd appreciate it if you would tell the monk at the Temple of Oghma, if you could. He knows to send word to my brother Gordon in Ulgoth's Beard. Gordon has a family of his own, and he and his wife would be good foster parents for her.~
@1679 = ~If you are unable to return, the monks will assume that I am dead if six months go by and I haven't visited or sent other word.~
@1680 = ~We've been apart for much of the last year, true, but before that, I was still living with her.~
@1681 = ~No. I would never do that. I could never do that.~
@1682 = ~How can you even suggest such a thing?! Unthinkable!~
@1683 = ~You speak of love like it's a finite thing. It isn't a basket of apples, where giving some to a child leaves less for another.~
@1684 = ~Not my favorite topic of conversation, but go on.~
@1685 = ~Are you still in love with her? You seemed very concerned for her wellbeing.~
@1686 = ~Do you think she'll be back?~
@1687 = ~You should have been more firm with her. You could have forced her to stay and raise Lanie.~
@1688 = ~You're too hard on her. I'm sure she wasn't the cruel, unloving parent you made her seem to be.~
@1689 = ~All women aren't like her. You do know that, right?~
@1690 = ~What do you think is going to happen to her?~
@1691 = ~I can sympathize with her. I would never want to be burdened with a child.~
@1692 = ~I don't understand how anyone could be so selfish.~
@1693 = ~I am concerned about her wellbeing. She's the mother of my daughter. I'm not in love with her, but that doesn't mean that I wish her harm.~
@1694 = ~I don't know. I hope she will, for Lanie's sake, but I don't know what the fates have in store for her.~
@1695 = ~A resentful person makes a very bad parent. It would be better for Lanie to be raised by just a father than to be raised by a mother who doesn't want her.~
@1696 = ~No, she wasn't cruel or unloving. There were times when she showed Lanie great affection and tenderness. But Miranda is ambitious, and a bit selfish. I guess the desire to make a better life for herself was stronger than her desire to be a good mother.~
@1697 = ~I do know that, and I'm glad of it.~
@1698 = ~I just don't know. After what happened with Cernd and Ahsdale, I'm concerned. Cernd's wife Gaia was driven by some of the same things Miranda is, the desire to find a powerful man to protect her, and in the end, it killed her. I would not want Miranda to share that fate.~
@1699 = ~I don't know. I hope she finds what she's looking for, but the path she's following is a dangerous one. There are men who would take advantage of a woman with Miranda's ambitions.~
@1700 = ~That doesn't bode well for our future marriage. If you really feel that way, you'd be better off breaking our engagement, because I'm always going to be a father to Lanie, even if we never have children of our own.~
@1701 = ~It's good that you know that now, then. You'll just have to make sure you never find yourself in that position.~
@1702 = ~She wasn't always that selfish, though she was always ambitious. I think you just saw her at her worst, after years of resentment and frustrated dreams made it impossible for her to ignore her own desires any longer.~
@1703 = ~I understand. Just let me know when things get calmer.~
@1704 = ~I'm glad to hear that.~
@1705 = ~(coughs)~
@1706 = ~If that's what you want, I'll be at the Temple of Lathander in Athkatla.~
@1707 = ~I'm sorry about our misunderstanding.~
@1708 = ~Where do you see this going?~
@1709 = ~This is difficult for me to say, but I'm beginning to think we should end this.~
@1710 = ~Please don't take this the wrong way, but I can't help noticing how close you and Imoen have always been.~
@1711 = ~There was a time when I would have said yes without question. Now...~
@1712 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm sorry, but I just can't take the uncertainty anymore. It isn't what I wanted, either, but done is done.~
@1713 = ~If you're asking how this will end, I just don't know. If you're asking if I believe that you and I have a future together...~
@1714 = ~<CHARNAME>, whatever future I have, it will be with you.~
@1715 = ~You've got enough on your mind. Maybe I'd better manage that from now on.~
@1716 = ~I'm sorry you feel that way, but I want you to be happy. If you want to end it, well, that's the way it has to be.~
@1717 = ~At least I can do something right. Too bad it wasn't making you happy.~

@1719 = ~Does that bother you?~
@1720 = ~Intensely.~
@1721 = ~No, as long as you remain focused on our current task.~
@1722 = ~Not at all! It's rather sweet, actually. I approve of the friendship the two of you share and I wouldn't mind if it developed into something more.~
@1723 = ~Er... thank you.~
@1724 = ~I'm sorry you feel that way, but it's difficult to travel day after day with someone and not become close to them.~
@1725 = ~It isn't a distraction.~
@1726 = ~I'd be glad to... er... maybe you could give me a hand with this?~
@1727 = ~Thank you. I'm rather attached to them.~
@1728 = ~We've been through a lot together.~
@1729 = ~As if I have nothing better to do than watch you nuzzle each other.~
@1730 = ~(Gavin's face may have lost some of the cheerful optimism it once wore, but his eyes are as kind and gentle as they have always been.)~
@1731 = ~(Gavin's habitual sunburn contrasts against the pale creases in his weathered face. You see worry-lines, it is true, but laugh-lines surround his eyes.)~

@1736 = ~(He smiles warmly, but surreptitiously checks to be sure that he has fastened all his laces.)~
@1737 = ~Ulgoth's Beard is more of a village, really. There aren't even any good roads between it and Baldur's Gate, which lies half a day to the south.~

@1741 = ~The more things change, the more they don't. I hoped that the trials he has undergone would mellow him a bit, but... well, he is what he is. I'm sure there are things he doesn't like about me, too.~
@1742 = ~Have you ever noticed that you can't win an argument with him? You get in a few good lines and then he says some ridiculous, irrefutable thing, and that's the end of the discussion.~
