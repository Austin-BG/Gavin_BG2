After a long-awaited honeymoon, the couple and Lanie returned to Athkatla and life became less hectic for a while... until their daughter was born. Eventually, it became impossible to ignore the signs that Gavin's faith would be part of some great "Deliverance". Following the miracle at the Temple of the Morn in 1374 DR, he attended a synod of his brethren at the Spires of the Morning in Waterdeep and returned deeply troubled. He joined the Order of the Aster in the same year and was instrumental in opening a chapter of the Order in Athakatla. He became very active in their recruitment campaign, though he was unwilling to travel far from the city until his children were old enough for his family to accompany him. Lanie struck out on her own in 1382 DR and was said to have joined the Harpers, and for the next two years, he heard nothing from her. She sent him a message after Spellplague to let him know that she survived and was not driven mad, but it was several more years before they could meet in person. By then, Amaunator's return was an established fact and Gavin had officially become the Sunmaster Chaplain of the Order of the Aster. He complained that the position left him chained to a desk, but if pressed for honesty, he would confess that he was grateful to be spared the necessity of leaving his family.

They blamed one thing or another, but if pressed for honesty, both would admit that they were happier this way. Their love for each other never faded, but they had become accustomed to living apart.
