99900 b!gavep0 - not a god, romanced, no kids

After <CHARNAME>'s victory at the Throne of Blood, Gavin returned to Athkatla, where he remained... until it became impossible to ignore the signs that his faith would be part of some great "Deliverance". Following the miracle at the Temple of the Morn in 1374 DR, he attended a synod of his brethren at the Spires of the Morning in Waterdeep and returned deeply troubled. He joined the Order of the Aster in the same year and was instrumental in opening a chapter of the Order in Athakatla. He became very active in their recruitment campaign, though he was unable to travel far from the city until Lanie was old enough to accompany him. She struck out on her own in 1382 DR and was said to have joined the Harpers, and for the next two years, he heard nothing from her. She sent him a message after Spellplague to let him know that she survived and was not driven mad, but it was several more years before they could meet in person. By then, Amaunator's return was an established fact and Gavin had officially become the Sunmaster Chaplain of the Order of the Aster, a title that kept him chained to a desk far more often than he would like. Throughout the remainder of his life, Gavin remained the devoted lover and occasional companion of <CHARNAME>. He promised that one day, their paths might be joined forever, never to be parted again, but that day never came. They blamed one thing or another, but if pressed for honesty, both would admit that they were happier this way. Their love for each other never faded, but they had become accustomed to living apart. Between <CHARNAME>'s wanderlust and Gavin's desire for stability, they were content to celebrate their union with frequent visits and occasional journeys together. It was on one of these visits that Gavin met his inevitable death. A very old man by then, he rose for his morning devotions and offered his soul to his god in truth... until the day when his soul will return to be with that of his beloved <CHARNAME> once more.

After <CHARNAME>'s victory at the Throne of Blood, the triumphant couple returned to Athkatla, where they remained until Lanie was able to accompany them to Beregost. There, <CHARNAME> and Gavin celebrated their vows in a ceremony presided over by Kelddath Ormlyr and attended by friends, Gavin's extended family, and more notables than the Song of the Morning could house. After a long-awaited honeymoon, the couple and Lanie returned to Athkatla and life became less hectic for a while... until it became impossible to ignore the signs that Gavin's faith would be part of some great "Deliverance". Following the miracle at the Temple of the Morn in 1374 DR, he attended a synod of his brethren at the Spires of the Morning in Waterdeep and returned deeply troubled.

By then, Amaunator's return was an established fact and Gavin had officially become the Sunmaster Chaplain of the Order of the Aster. He complained that the position entailed a great deal of travel, but if pressed for honesty, he would confess that he did not care where he journeyed... as long as he traveled with his beloved <CHARNAME>. It was on one of these infrequent visits to their home in Athkatla that Gavin met his inevitable death. A very old man by then, he rose for his morning devotions and offered his soul to his god in truth... until the day when his soul will return to be with <CHARNAME>'s once more.
